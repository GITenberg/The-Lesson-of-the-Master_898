description: '<p><b>"You know as well as you sit there that you''d put a pistol-ball
  into your brain if you had written my books!"</b><br><br>Exemplifying Henry James''s
  famous belief  that "Art makes life," <i>The Lesson of the Master</i> is a piercing
  study of the life that  art makes. When the tale''s protagonist--a gifted young
  writer--meets and befriends  a famous author he has long idolized, he is both repelled
  by and attracted to the  artist''s great secret: the emotional costs of a life dedicated
  to art.<br><br> With extraordinary  psychological insight and devastating wit, the
  novella asks the question of whether  art is, ultimately, demeaning or ennobling
  for the artist, while capturing the ambiguities  of a life devoted to art, and the
  choices artists must make. The expatriate James  knew these choice well by the time
  he published the novella in the <i>Universal Review</i> in 1888, and the work reveals
  him at the height of his powers.<br><br> <b>The Art of The Novella Series<br><br>...'
