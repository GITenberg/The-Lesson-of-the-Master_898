<h2><a name="page5"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 5</span>I</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">He</span> had been told the ladies were at
church, but this was corrected by what he saw from the top of the
steps&mdash;they descended from a great height in two arms, with
a circular sweep of the most charming effect&mdash;at the
threshold of the door which, from the long bright gallery,
overlooked the immense lawn.&nbsp; Three gentlemen, on the grass,
at a distance, sat under the great trees, while the fourth figure
showed a crimson dress that told as a &ldquo;bit of colour&rdquo;
amid the fresh rich green.&nbsp; The servant had so far
accompanied Paul Overt as to introduce him to this view, after
asking him if he wished first to go to his room.&nbsp; The young
man declined that privilege, conscious of no disrepair from so
short and easy a journey and always liking to take at once a
general perceptive possession of a new scene.&nbsp; He stood
there a little with his eyes on the group and on the admirable
picture, the wide grounds of an old country-house near
London&mdash;that only made it better&mdash;on a splendid Sunday
in June.&nbsp; &ldquo;But that lady, who&rsquo;s
<i>she</i>?&rdquo; he said to the servant before the man left
him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think she&rsquo;s Mrs. St. George, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mrs. St. George, the wife of the
distinguished&mdash;&rdquo;&nbsp; Then Paul Overt checked
himself, doubting if a footman would know.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir&mdash;probably, sir,&rdquo; said his guide,
who appeared to wish to intimate that a person staying at
Summersoft would naturally be, if only by alliance,
distinguished.&nbsp; His tone, however, made poor Overt himself
feel for the moment scantly so.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And the gentlemen?&rdquo; Overt went on.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, sir, one of them&rsquo;s General
Fancourt.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah yes, I know; thank you.&rdquo;&nbsp; General
Fancourt was distinguished, there was no doubt of that, for
something he had done, or perhaps even hadn&rsquo;t
done&mdash;the young man couldn&rsquo;t remember which&mdash;some
years before in India.&nbsp; The servant went away, leaving the
glass doors open into the gallery, and Paul Overt remained at the
head of the wide double staircase, saying to himself that the
place was sweet and promised a pleasant visit, while he leaned on
the balustrade of fine old ironwork which, like all the other
details, was of the same period as the house.&nbsp; It all went
together and spoke in one voice&mdash;a rich English voice of the
early part of the eighteenth century.&nbsp; It might have been
church-time on a summer&rsquo;s day in the reign of Queen Anne;
the stillness was too perfect to be modern, the nearness counted
so as distance, and there was something so fresh and sound in the
originality of the large smooth house, the expanse of beautiful
brickwork that showed for pink rather than red and that had been
kept clear of messy creepers by the law under which a woman with
a rare complexion disdains a veil.&nbsp; When Paul Overt became
aware that the people under the trees had noticed him he turned
back through the open doors into the great gallery which was the
pride of the place.&nbsp; It marched across from end to end and
seemed&mdash;with its bright colours, its high panelled windows,
its faded flowered chintzes, its quickly-recognised portraits and
pictures, the blue-and-white china of its cabinets and the
attenuated festoons and rosettes of its ceiling&mdash;a cheerful
upholstered avenue into the other century.</p>
<p>Our friend was slightly nervous; that went with his character
as a student of fine prose, went with the artist&rsquo;s general
disposition to vibrate; and there was a particular thrill in the
idea that Henry St. George might be a member of the party.&nbsp;
For the young aspirant he had remained a high literary figure, in
spite of the lower range of production to which he had fallen
after his first three great successes, the comparative absence of
quality in his later work.&nbsp; There had been moments when Paul
Overt almost shed tears for this; but now that he was near
him&mdash;he had never met him&mdash;he was conscious only of the
fine original source and of his own immense debt.&nbsp; After he
had taken a turn or two up and down the gallery he came out again
and descended the steps.&nbsp; He was but slenderly supplied with
a certain social boldness&mdash;it was really a weakness in
him&mdash;so that, conscious of a want of acquaintance with the
four persons in the distance, he gave way to motions recommended
by their not committing him to a positive approach.&nbsp; There
was a fine English awkwardness in this&mdash;he felt that too as
he sauntered vaguely and obliquely across the lawn, taking an
independent line.&nbsp; Fortunately there was an equally fine
English directness in the way one of the gentlemen presently rose
and made as if to &ldquo;stalk&rdquo; him, though with an air of
conciliation and reassurance.&nbsp; To this demonstration Paul
Overt instantly responded, even if the gentleman were not his
host.&nbsp; He was tall, straight and elderly and had, like the
great house itself, a pink smiling face, and into the bargain a
white moustache.&nbsp; Our young man met him halfway while he
laughed and said: &ldquo;Er&mdash;Lady Watermouth told us you
were coming; she asked me just to look after you.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Paul Overt thanked him, liking him on the spot, and turned round
with him to walk toward the others.&nbsp; &ldquo;They&rsquo;ve
all gone to church&mdash;all except us,&rdquo; the stranger
continued as they went; &ldquo;we&rsquo;re just sitting
here&mdash;it&rsquo;s so jolly.&rdquo;&nbsp; Overt pronounced it
jolly indeed: it was such a lovely place.&nbsp; He mentioned that
he was having the charming impression for the first time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah you&rsquo;ve not been here before?&rdquo; said his
companion.&nbsp; &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a nice little place&mdash;not
much to <i>do</i>, you know&rdquo;.&nbsp; Overt wondered what he
wanted to &ldquo;do&rdquo;&mdash;he felt that he himself was
doing so much.&nbsp; By the time they came to where the others
sat he had recognised his initiator for a military man
and&mdash;such was the turn of Overt&rsquo;s
imagination&mdash;had found him thus still more
sympathetic.&nbsp; He would naturally have a need for action, for
deeds at variance with the pacific pastoral scene.&nbsp; He was
evidently so good-natured, however, that he accepted the
inglorious hour for what it was worth.&nbsp; Paul Overt shared it
with him and with his companions for the next twenty minutes; the
latter looked at him and he looked at them without knowing much
who they were, while the talk went on without much telling him
even what it meant.&nbsp; It seemed indeed to mean nothing in
particular; it wandered, with casual pointless pauses and short
terrestrial flights, amid names of persons and places&mdash;names
which, for our friend, had no great power of evocation.&nbsp; It
was all sociable and slow, as was right and natural of a warm
Sunday morning.</p>
<p>His first attention was given to the question, privately
considered, of whether one of the two younger men would be Henry
St. George.&nbsp; He knew many of his distinguished
contemporaries by their photographs, but had never, as happened,
seen a portrait of the great misguided novelist.&nbsp; One of the
gentlemen was unimaginable&mdash;he was too young; and the other
scarcely looked clever enough, with such mild undiscriminating
eyes.&nbsp; If those eyes were St. George&rsquo;s the problem,
presented by the ill-matched parts of his genius would be still
more difficult of solution.&nbsp; Besides, the deportment of
their proprietor was not, as regards the lady in the red dress,
such as could be natural, toward the wife of his bosom, even to a
writer accused by several critics of sacrificing too much to
manner.&nbsp; Lastly Paul Overt had a vague sense that if the
gentleman with the expressionless eyes bore the name that had set
his heart beating faster (he also had contradictory conventional
whiskers&mdash;the young admirer of the celebrity had never in a
mental vision seen <i>his</i> face in so vulgar a frame) he would
have given him a sign of recognition or of friendliness, would
have heard of him a little, would know something about
&ldquo;Ginistrella,&rdquo; would have an impression of how that
fresh fiction had caught the eye of real criticism.&nbsp; Paul
Overt had a dread of being grossly proud, but even morbid modesty
might view the authorship of &ldquo;Ginistrella&rdquo; as
constituting a degree of identity.&nbsp; His soldierly friend
became clear enough: he was &ldquo;Fancourt,&rdquo; but was also
&ldquo;the General&rdquo;; and he mentioned to the new visitor in
the course of a few moments that he had but lately returned from
twenty years service abroad.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now you remain in England?&rdquo; the young man
asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh yes; I&rsquo;ve bought a small house in
London.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I hope you like it,&rdquo; said Overt, looking at
Mrs. St. George.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, a little house in Manchester
Square&mdash;there&rsquo;s a limit to the enthusiasm <i>that</i>
inspires.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh I meant being at home again&mdash;being back in
Piccadilly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My daughter likes Piccadilly&mdash;that&rsquo;s the
main thing.&nbsp; She&rsquo;s very fond of art and music and
literature and all that kind of thing.&nbsp; She missed it in
India and she finds it in London, or she hopes she&rsquo;ll find
it.&nbsp; Mr. St. George has promised to help her&mdash;he has
been awfully kind to her.&nbsp; She has gone to
church&mdash;she&rsquo;s fond of that too&mdash;but they&rsquo;ll
all be back in a quarter of an hour.&nbsp; You must let me
introduce you to her&mdash;she&rsquo;ll be so glad to know
you.&nbsp; I dare say she has read every blest word you&rsquo;ve
written.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall be delighted&mdash;I haven&rsquo;t written so
very many,&rdquo; Overt pleaded, feeling, and without resentment,
that the General at least was vagueness itself about that.&nbsp;
But he wondered a little why, expressing this friendly
disposition, it didn&rsquo;t occur to the doubtless eminent
soldier to pronounce the word that would put him in relation with
Mrs. St. George.&nbsp; If it was a question of introductions Miss
Fancourt&mdash;apparently as yet unmarried&mdash;was far away,
while the wife of his illustrious confr&egrave;re was almost
between them.&nbsp; This lady struck Paul Overt as altogether
pretty, with a surprising juvenility and a high smartness of
aspect, something that&mdash;he could scarcely have said
why&mdash;served for mystification.&nbsp; St. George certainly
had every right to a charming wife, but he himself would never
have imagined the important little woman in the aggressively
Parisian dress the partner for life, the alter ego, of a man of
letters.&nbsp; That partner in general, he knew, that second
self, was far from presenting herself in a single type:
observation had taught him that she was not inveterately, not
necessarily plain.&nbsp; But he had never before seen her look so
much as if her prosperity had deeper foundations than an
ink-spotted study-table littered with proof-sheets.&nbsp; Mrs.
St. George might have been the wife of a gentleman who
&ldquo;kept&rdquo; books rather than wrote them, who carried on
great affairs in the City and made better bargains than those
that poets mostly make with publishers.&nbsp; With this she
hinted at a success more personal&mdash;a success peculiarly
stamping the age in which society, the world of conversation, is
a great drawing-room with the City for its antechamber.&nbsp;
Overt numbered her years at first as some thirty, and then ended
by believing that she might approach her fiftieth.&nbsp; But she
somehow in this case juggled away the excess and the
difference&mdash;you only saw them in a rare glimpse, like the
rabbit in the conjurer&rsquo;s sleeve.&nbsp; She was
extraordinarily white, and her every element and item was pretty;
her eyes, her ears, her hair, her voice, her hands, her
feet&mdash;to which her relaxed attitude in her wicker chair gave
a great publicity&mdash;and the numerous ribbons and trinkets
with which she was bedecked.&nbsp; She looked as if she had put
on her best clothes to go to church and then had decided they
were too good for that and had stayed at home.&nbsp; She told a
story of some length about the shabby way Lady Jane had treated
the Duchess, as well as an anecdote in relation to a purchase she
had made in Paris&mdash;on her way back from Cannes; made for
Lady Egbert, who had never refunded the money.&nbsp; Paul Overt
suspected her of a tendency to figure great people as larger than
life, until he noticed the manner in which she handled Lady
Egbert, which was so sharply mutinous that it reassured
him.&nbsp; He felt he should have understood her better if he
might have met her eye; but she scarcely so much as glanced at
him.&nbsp; &ldquo;Ah here they come&mdash;all the good
ones!&rdquo; she said at last; and Paul Overt admired at his
distance the return of the church-goers&mdash;several persons, in
couples and threes, advancing in a flicker of sun and shade at
the end of a large green vista formed by the level grass and the
overarching boughs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you mean to imply that <i>we&rsquo;re</i> bad, I
protest,&rdquo; said one of the gentlemen&mdash;&ldquo;after
making one&rsquo;s self agreeable all the morning!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah if they&rsquo;ve found you agreeable&mdash;!&rdquo;
Mrs. St. George gaily cried.&nbsp; &ldquo;But if we&rsquo;re good
the others are better.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They must be angels then,&rdquo; said the amused
General.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your husband was an angel, the way he went off at your
bidding,&rdquo; the gentleman who had first spoken declared to
Mrs. St. George.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At my bidding?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t you make him go to church?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I never made him do anything in my life but
once&mdash;when I made him burn up a bad book.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s
all!&rdquo;&nbsp; At her &ldquo;That&rsquo;s all!&rdquo; our
young friend broke into an irrepressible laugh; it lasted only a
second, but it drew her eyes to him.&nbsp; His own met them,
though not long enough to help him to understand her; unless it
were a step towards this that he saw on the instant how the burnt
book&mdash;the way she alluded to it!&mdash;would have been one
of her husband&rsquo;s finest things.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A bad book?&rdquo; her interlocutor repeated.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t like it.&nbsp; He went to church because
your daughter went,&rdquo; she continued to General
Fancourt.&nbsp; &ldquo;I think it my duty to call your attention
to his extraordinary demonstrations to your daughter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, if you don&rsquo;t mind them I
don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; the General laughed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Il s&rsquo;attache &agrave; ses pas.&nbsp; But I
don&rsquo;t wonder&mdash;she&rsquo;s so charming.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope she won&rsquo;t make him burn any books!&rdquo;
Paul Overt ventured to exclaim.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If she&rsquo;d make him write a few it would be more to
the purpose,&rdquo; said Mrs. St. George.&nbsp; &ldquo;He has
been of a laziness of late&mdash;!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Our young man stared&mdash;he was so struck with the
lady&rsquo;s phraseology.&nbsp; Her &ldquo;Write a few&rdquo;
seemed to him almost as good as her &ldquo;That&rsquo;s
all.&rdquo;&nbsp; Didn&rsquo;t she, as the wife of a rare artist,
know what it was to produce one perfect work of art?&nbsp; How in
the world did she think they were turned on?&nbsp; His private
conviction was that, admirably as Henry St. George wrote, he had
written for the last ten years, and especially for the last five,
only too much, and there was an instant during which he felt
inwardly solicited to make this public.&nbsp; But before he had
spoken a diversion was effected by the return of the
absentees.&nbsp; They strolled up dispersedly&mdash;there were
eight or ten of them&mdash;and the circle under the trees
rearranged itself as they took their place in it.&nbsp; They made
it much larger, so that Paul Overt could feel&mdash;he was always
feeling that sort of thing, as he said to himself&mdash;that if
the company had already been interesting to watch the interest
would now become intense.&nbsp; He shook hands with his hostess,
who welcomed him without many words, in the manner of a woman
able to trust him to understand and conscious that so pleasant an
occasion would in every way speak for itself.&nbsp; She offered
him no particular facility for sitting by her, and when they had
all subsided again he found himself still next General Fancourt,
with an unknown lady on his other flank.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s my daughter&mdash;that one
opposite,&rdquo; the General said to him without lose of
time.&nbsp; Overt saw a tall girl, with magnificent red hair, in
a dress of a pretty grey-green tint and of a limp silken texture,
a garment that clearly shirked every modern effect.&nbsp; It had
therefore somehow the stamp of the latest thing, so that our
beholder quickly took her for nothing if not contemporaneous.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s very handsome&mdash;very handsome,&rdquo;
he repeated while he considered her.&nbsp; There was something
noble in her head, and she appeared fresh and strong.</p>
<p>Her good father surveyed her with complacency, remarking soon:
&ldquo;She looks too hot&mdash;that&rsquo;s her walk.&nbsp; But
she&rsquo;ll be all right presently.&nbsp; Then I&rsquo;ll make
her come over and speak to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should be sorry to give you that trouble.&nbsp; If
you were to take me over <i>there</i>&mdash;!&rdquo; the young
man murmured.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear sir, do you suppose I put myself out that
way?&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t mean for you, but for Marian,&rdquo; the
General added.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>I</i> would put myself out for her soon
enough,&rdquo; Overt replied; after which he went on: &ldquo;Will
you be so good as to tell me which of those gentlemen is Henry
St. George?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The fellow talking to my girl.&nbsp; By Jove, he
<i>is</i> making up to her&mdash;they&rsquo;re going off for
another walk.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah is that he&mdash;really?&rdquo;&nbsp; Our friend
felt a certain surprise, for the personage before him seemed to
trouble a vision which had been vague only while not confronted
with the reality.&nbsp; As soon as the reality dawned the mental
image, retiring with a sigh, became substantial enough to suffer
a slight wrong.&nbsp; Overt, who had spent a considerable part of
his short life in foreign lands, made now, but not for the first
time, the reflexion that whereas in those countries he had almost
always recognised the artist and the man of letters by his
personal &ldquo;type,&rdquo; the mould of his face, the character
of his head, the expression of his figure and even the
indications of his dress, so in England this identification was
as little as possible a matter of course, thanks to the greater
conformity, the habit of sinking the profession instead of
advertising it, the general diffusion of the air of the
gentleman&mdash;the gentleman committed to no particular set of
ideas.&nbsp; More than once, on returning to his own country, he
had said to himself about people met in society: &ldquo;One sees
them in this place and that, and one even talks with them; but to
find out what they <i>do</i> one would really have to be a
detective.&rdquo;&nbsp; In respect to several individuals whose
work he was the opposite of &ldquo;drawn to&rdquo;&mdash;perhaps
he was wrong&mdash;he found himself adding &ldquo;No wonder they
conceal it&mdash;when it&rsquo;s so bad!&rdquo;&nbsp; He noted
that oftener than in France and in Germany his artist looked like
a gentleman&mdash;that is like an English one&mdash;while,
certainly outside a few exceptions, his gentlemen didn&rsquo;t
look like an artist.&nbsp; St. George was not one of the
exceptions; that circumstance he definitely apprehended before
the great man had turned his back to walk off with Miss
Fancourt.&nbsp; He certainly looked better behind than any
foreign man of letters&mdash;showed for beautifully correct in
his tall black hat and his superior frock coat.&nbsp; Somehow,
all the same, these very garments&mdash;he wouldn&rsquo;t have
minded them so much on a weekday&mdash;were disconcerting to Paul
Overt, who forgot for the moment that the head of the profession
was not a bit better dressed than himself.&nbsp; He had caught a
glimpse of a regular face, a fresh colour, a brown moustache and
a pair of eyes surely never visited by a fine frenzy, and he
promised himself to study these denotements on the first
occasion.&nbsp; His superficial sense was that their owner might
have passed for a lucky stockbroker&mdash;a gentleman driving
eastward every morning from a sanitary suburb in a smart
dog-cart.&nbsp; That carried out the impression already derived
from his wife.&nbsp; Paul&rsquo;s glance, after a moment,
travelled back to this lady, and he saw how her own had followed
her husband as he moved off with Miss Fancourt.&nbsp; Overt
permitted himself to wonder a little if she were jealous when
another woman took him away.&nbsp; Then he made out that Mrs. St.
George wasn&rsquo;t glaring at the indifferent maiden.&nbsp; Her
eyes rested but on her husband, and with unmistakeable
serenity.&nbsp; That was the way she wanted him to be&mdash;she
liked his conventional uniform.&nbsp; Overt longed to hear more
about the book she had induced him to destroy.</p>
<h2><a name="page21"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
21</span>II</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">As</span> they all came out from luncheon
General Fancourt took hold of him with an &ldquo;I say, I want
you to know my girl!&rdquo; as if the idea had just occurred to
him and he hadn&rsquo;t spoken of it before.&nbsp; With the other
hand he possessed himself all paternally of the young lady.&nbsp;
&ldquo;You know all about him.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve seen you with his
books.&nbsp; She reads everything&mdash;everything!&rdquo; he
went on to Paul.&nbsp; The girl smiled at him and then laughed at
her father.&nbsp; The General turned away and his daughter
spoke&mdash;&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t papa delightful?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is indeed, Miss Fancourt.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As if I read you because I read
&lsquo;everything&rsquo;!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh I don&rsquo;t mean for saying that,&rdquo; said Paul
Overt.&nbsp; &ldquo;I liked him from the moment he began to be
kind to me.&nbsp; Then he promised me this privilege.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t for you he means it&mdash;it&rsquo;s for
me.&nbsp; If you flatter yourself that he thinks of anything in
life but me you&rsquo;ll find you&rsquo;re mistaken.&nbsp; He
introduces every one.&nbsp; He thinks me insatiable.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You speak just like him,&rdquo; laughed our youth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah but sometimes I want to&rdquo;&mdash;and the girl
coloured.&nbsp; &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t read everything&mdash;I read
very little.&nbsp; But I <i>have</i> read you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Suppose we go into the gallery,&rdquo; said Paul
Overt.&nbsp; She pleased him greatly, not so much because of this
last remark&mdash;though that of course was not too
disconcerting&mdash;as because, seated opposite to him at
luncheon, she had given him for half an hour the impression of
her beautiful face.&nbsp; Something else had come with it&mdash;a
sense of generosity, of an enthusiasm which, unlike many
enthusiasms, was not all manner.&nbsp; That was not spoiled for
him by his seeing that the repast had placed her again in
familiar contact with Henry St. George.&nbsp; Sitting next her
this celebrity was also opposite our young man, who had been able
to note that he multiplied the attentions lately brought by his
wife to the General&rsquo;s notice.&nbsp; Paul Overt had gathered
as well that this lady was not in the least discomposed by these
fond excesses and that she gave every sign of an unclouded
spirit.&nbsp; She had Lord Masham on one side of her and on the
other the accomplished Mr. Mulliner, editor of the new high-class
lively evening paper which was expected to meet a want felt in
circles increasingly conscious that Conservatism must be made
amusing, and unconvinced when assured by those of another
political colour that it was already amusing enough.&nbsp; At the
end of an hour spent in her company Paul Overt thought her still
prettier than at the first radiation, and if her profane
allusions to her husband&rsquo;s work had not still rung in his
ears he should have liked her&mdash;so far as it could be a
question of that in connexion with a woman to whom he had not yet
spoken and to whom probably he should never speak if it were left
to her.&nbsp; Pretty women were a clear need to this genius, and
for the hour it was Miss Fancourt who supplied the want.&nbsp; If
Overt had promised himself a closer view the occasion was now of
the best, and it brought consequences felt by the young man as
important.&nbsp; He saw more in St. George&rsquo;s face, which he
liked the better for its not having told its whole story in the
first three minutes.&nbsp; That story came out as one read, in
short instalments&mdash;it was excusable that one&rsquo;s
analogies should be somewhat professional&mdash;and the text was
a style considerably involved, a language not easy to translate
at sight.&nbsp; There were shades of meaning in it and a vague
perspective of history which receded as you advanced.&nbsp; Two
facts Paul had particularly heeded.&nbsp; The first of these was
that he liked the measured mask much better at inscrutable rest
than in social agitation; its almost convulsive smile above all
displeased him (as much as any impression from that source
could), whereas the quiet face had a charm that grew in
proportion as stillness settled again.&nbsp; The change to the
expression of gaiety excited, he made out, very much the private
protest of a person sitting gratefully in the twilight when the
lamp is brought in too soon.&nbsp; His second reflexion was that,
though generally averse to the flagrant use of ingratiating arts
by a man of age &ldquo;making up&rdquo; to a pretty girl, he was
not in this case too painfully affected: which seemed to prove
either that St. George had a light hand or the air of being
younger than he was, or else that Miss Fancourt&rsquo;s own
manner somehow made everything right.</p>
<p>Overt walked with her into the gallery, and they strolled to
the end of it, looking at the pictures, the cabinets, the
charming vista, which harmonised with the prospect of the summer
afternoon, resembling it by a long brightness, with great divans
and old chairs that figured hours of rest.&nbsp; Such a place as
that had the added merit of giving those who came into it plenty
to talk about.&nbsp; Miss Fancourt sat down with her new
acquaintance on a flowered sofa, the cushions of which, very
numerous, were tight ancient cubes of many sizes, and presently
said: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m so glad to have a chance to thank
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To thank me&mdash;?&rdquo;&nbsp; He had to wonder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I liked your book so much.&nbsp; I think it
splendid.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She sat there smiling at him, and he never asked himself which
book she meant; for after all he had written three or four.&nbsp;
That seemed a vulgar detail, and he wasn&rsquo;t even gratified
by the idea of the pleasure she told him&mdash;her handsome
bright face told him&mdash;he had given her.&nbsp; The feeling
she appealed to, or at any rate the feeling she excited, was
something larger, something that had little to do with any
quickened pulsation of his own vanity.&nbsp; It was responsive
admiration of the life she embodied, the young purity and
richness of which appeared to imply that real success was to
resemble <i>that</i>, to live, to bloom, to present the
perfection of a fine type, not to have hammered out headachy
fancies with a bent back at an ink-stained table.&nbsp; While her
grey eyes rested on him&mdash;there was a wideish space between
these, and the division of her rich-coloured hair, so thick that
it ventured to be smooth, made a free arch above them&mdash;he
was almost ashamed of that exercise of the pen which it was her
present inclination to commend.&nbsp; He was conscious he should
have liked better to please her in some other way.&nbsp; The
lines of her face were those of a woman grown, but the child
lingered on in her complexion and in the sweetness of her
mouth.&nbsp; Above all she was natural&mdash;that was indubitable
now; more natural than he had supposed at first, perhaps on
account of her &aelig;sthetic toggery, which was conventionally
unconventional, suggesting what he might have called a tortuous
spontaneity.&nbsp; He had feared that sort of thing in other
cases, and his fears had been justified; for, though he was an
artist to the essence, the modern reactionary nymph, with the
brambles of the woodland caught in her folds and a look as if the
satyrs had toyed with her hair, made him shrink not as a man of
starch and patent leather, but as a man potentially himself a
poet or even a faun.&nbsp; The girl was really more candid than
her costume, and the best proof of it was her supposing her
liberal character suited by any uniform.&nbsp; This was a
fallacy, since if she was draped as a pessimist he was sure she
liked the taste of life.&nbsp; He thanked her for her
appreciation&mdash;aware at the same time that he didn&rsquo;t
appear to thank her enough and that she might think him
ungracious.&nbsp; He was afraid she would ask him to explain
something he had written, and he always winced at
that&mdash;perhaps too timidly&mdash;for to his own ear the
explanation of a work of art sounded fatuous.&nbsp; But he liked
her so much as to feel a confidence that in the long run he
should be able to show her he wasn&rsquo;t rudely evasive.&nbsp;
Moreover she surely wasn&rsquo;t quick to take offence,
wasn&rsquo;t irritable; she could be trusted to wait.&nbsp; So
when he said to her, &ldquo;Ah don&rsquo;t talk of anything
I&rsquo;ve done, don&rsquo;t talk of it <i>here</i>;
there&rsquo;s another man in the house who&rsquo;s the
actuality!&rdquo;&mdash;when he uttered this short sincere
protest it was with the sense that she would see in the words
neither mock humility nor the impatience of a successful man
bored with praise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mean Mr. St. George&mdash;isn&rsquo;t he
delightful?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Paul Overt met her eyes, which had a cool morning-light that
would have half-broken his heart if he hadn&rsquo;t been so
young.&nbsp; &ldquo;Alas I don&rsquo;t know him.&nbsp; I only
admire him at a distance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh you must know him&mdash;he wants so to talk to
you,&rdquo; returned Miss Fancourt, who evidently had the habit
of saying the things that, by her quick calculation, would give
people pleasure.&nbsp; Paul saw how she would always calculate on
everything&rsquo;s being simple between others.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shouldn&rsquo;t have supposed he knew anything about
me,&rdquo; he professed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He does then&mdash;everything.&nbsp; And if he
didn&rsquo;t I should be able to tell him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To tell him everything?&rdquo; our friend smiled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You talk just like the people in your book!&rdquo; she
answered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then they must all talk alike.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She thought a moment, not a bit disconcerted.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Well, it must be so difficult.&nbsp; Mr. St. George tells
me it <i>is</i>&mdash;terribly.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve tried
too&mdash;and I find it so.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve tried to write a
novel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. St. George oughtn&rsquo;t to discourage you,&rdquo;
Paul went so far as to say.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You do much more&mdash;when you wear that
expression.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, after all, why try to be an artist?&rdquo; the
young man pursued.&nbsp; &ldquo;It&rsquo;s so poor&mdash;so
poor!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what you mean,&rdquo; said Miss
Fancourt, who looked grave.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I mean as compared with being a person of
action&mdash;as living your works.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But what&rsquo;s art but an intense life&mdash;if it be
real?&rdquo; she asked.&nbsp; &ldquo;I think it&rsquo;s the only
one&mdash;everything else is so clumsy!&rdquo;&nbsp; Her
companion laughed, and she brought out with her charming serenity
what next struck her.&nbsp; &ldquo;It&rsquo;s so interesting to
meet so many celebrated people.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So I should think&mdash;but surely it isn&rsquo;t new
to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why I&rsquo;ve never seen any one&mdash;any one: living
always in Asia.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The way she talked of Asia somehow enchanted him.&nbsp;
&ldquo;But doesn&rsquo;t that continent swarm with great
figures?&nbsp; Haven&rsquo;t you administered provinces in India
and had captive rajahs and tributary princes chained to your
car?&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was as if she didn&rsquo;t care even <i>should</i> he amuse
himself at her cost.&nbsp; &ldquo;I was with my father, after I
left school to go out there.&nbsp; It was delightful being with
him&mdash;we&rsquo;re alone together in the world, he and
I&mdash;but there was none of the society I like best.&nbsp; One
never heard of a picture&mdash;never of a book, except bad
ones.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never of a picture?&nbsp; Why, wasn&rsquo;t all life a
picture?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She looked over the delightful place where they sat.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Nothing to compare to this.&nbsp; I adore England!&rdquo;
she cried.</p>
<p>It fairly stirred in him the sacred chord.&nbsp; &ldquo;Ah of
course I don&rsquo;t deny that we must do something with her,
poor old dear, yet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She hasn&rsquo;t been touched, really,&rdquo; said the
girl.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did Mr. St. George say that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was a small and, as he felt, harmless spark of irony in
his question; which, however, she answered very simply, not
noticing the insinuation.&nbsp; &ldquo;Yes, he says England
hasn&rsquo;t been touched&mdash;not considering all there
is,&rdquo; she went on eagerly.&nbsp; &ldquo;He&rsquo;s so
interesting about our country.&nbsp; To listen to him makes one
want so to do something.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It would make <i>me</i> want to,&rdquo; said Paul
Overt, feeling strongly, on the instant, the suggestion of what
she said and that of the emotion with which she said it, and well
aware of what an incentive, on St. George&rsquo;s lips, such a
speech might be.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh you&mdash;as if you hadn&rsquo;t!&nbsp; I should
like so to hear you talk together,&rdquo; she added ardently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s very genial of you; but he&rsquo;d have it
all his own way.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m prostrate before him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She had an air of earnestness.&nbsp; &ldquo;Do you think then
he&rsquo;s so perfect?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Far from it.&nbsp; Some of his later books seem to me
of a queerness&mdash;!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, yes&mdash;he knows that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Paul Overt stared.&nbsp; &ldquo;That they seem to me of a
queerness&mdash;!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well yes, or at any rate that they&rsquo;re not what
they should be.&nbsp; He told me he didn&rsquo;t esteem
them.&nbsp; He has told me such wonderful things&mdash;he&rsquo;s
so interesting.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was a certain shock for Paul Overt in the knowledge that
the fine genius they were talking of had been reduced to so
explicit a confession and had made it, in his misery, to the
first comer; for though Miss Fancourt was charming what was she
after all but an immature girl encountered at a
country-house?&nbsp; Yet precisely this was part of the sentiment
he himself had just expressed: he would make way completely for
the poor peccable great man not because he didn&rsquo;t read him
clear, but altogether because he did.&nbsp; His consideration was
half composed of tenderness for superficialities which he was
sure their perpetrator judged privately, judged more ferociously
than any one, and which represented some tragic intellectual
secret.&nbsp; He would have his reasons for his psychology
&agrave; fleur de peau, and these reasons could only be cruel
ones, such as would make him dearer to those who already were
fond of him.&nbsp; &ldquo;You excite my envy.&nbsp; I have my
reserves, I discriminate&mdash;but I love him,&rdquo; Paul said
in a moment.&nbsp; &ldquo;And seeing him for the first time this
way is a great event for me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How momentous&mdash;how magnificent!&rdquo; cried the
girl.&nbsp; &ldquo;How delicious to bring you
together!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your doing it&mdash;that makes it perfect,&rdquo; our
friend returned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s as eager as you,&rdquo; she went on.&nbsp;
&ldquo;But it&rsquo;s so odd you shouldn&rsquo;t have
met.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not really so odd as it strikes you.&nbsp;
I&rsquo;ve been out of England so much&mdash;made repeated
absences all these last years.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She took this in with interest.&nbsp; &ldquo;And yet you write
of it as well as if you were always here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s just the being away perhaps.&nbsp; At any
rate the best bits, I suspect, are those that were done in dreary
places abroad.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And why were they dreary?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because they were health-resorts&mdash;where my poor
mother was dying.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your poor mother?&rdquo;&mdash;she was all sweet
wonder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We went from place to place to help her to get
better.&nbsp; But she never did.&nbsp; To the deadly Riviera (I
hate it!) to the high Alps, to Algiers, and far away&mdash;a
hideous journey&mdash;to Colorado.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And she isn&rsquo;t better?&rdquo; Miss Fancourt went
on.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She died a year ago.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Really?&mdash;like mine!&nbsp; Only that&rsquo;s years
since.&nbsp; Some day you must tell me about your mother,&rdquo;
she added.</p>
<p>He could at first, on this, only gaze at her.&nbsp;
&ldquo;What right things you say!&nbsp; If you say them to St.
George I don&rsquo;t wonder he&rsquo;s in bondage.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It pulled her up for a moment.&nbsp; &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know
what you mean.&nbsp; He doesn&rsquo;t make speeches and
professions at all&mdash;he isn&rsquo;t ridiculous.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid you consider then that I
am.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I don&rsquo;t&rdquo;&mdash;she spoke it rather
shortly.&nbsp; And then she added: &ldquo;He
understands&mdash;understands everything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The young man was on the point of saying jocosely: &ldquo;And
I don&rsquo;t&mdash;is that it?&rdquo;&nbsp; But these words, in
time, changed themselves to others slightly less trivial:
&ldquo;Do you suppose he understands his wife?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Miss Fancourt made no direct answer, but after a
moment&rsquo;s hesitation put it: &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t she
charming?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not in the least!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here he comes.&nbsp; Now you must know him,&rdquo; she
went on.&nbsp; A small group of visitors had gathered at the
other end of the gallery and had been there overtaken by Henry
St. George, who strolled in from a neighbouring room.&nbsp; He
stood near them a moment, not falling into the talk but taking up
an old miniature from a table and vaguely regarding it.&nbsp; At
the end of a minute he became aware of Miss Fancourt and her
companion in the distance; whereupon, laying down his miniature,
he approached them with the same procrastinating air, his hands
in his pockets and his eyes turned, right and left, to the
pictures.&nbsp; The gallery was so long that this transit took
some little time, especially as there was a moment when he
stopped to admire the fine Gainsborough.&nbsp; &ldquo;He says
Mrs. St. George has been the making of him,&rdquo; the girl
continued in a voice slightly lowered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah he&rsquo;s often obscure!&rdquo; Paul laughed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Obscure?&rdquo; she repeated as if she heard it for the
first time.&nbsp; Her eyes rested on her other friend, and it
wasn&rsquo;t lost upon Paul that they appeared to send out great
shafts of softness.&nbsp; &ldquo;He&rsquo;s going to speak to
us!&rdquo; she fondly breathed.&nbsp; There was a sort of rapture
in her voice, and our friend was startled.&nbsp; &ldquo;Bless my
soul, does she care for him like <i>that</i>?&mdash;is she in
love with him?&rdquo; he mentally enquired.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t I tell you he was eager?&rdquo; she had
meanwhile asked of him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s eagerness dissimulated,&rdquo; the young man
returned as the subject of their observation lingered before his
Gainsborough.&nbsp; &ldquo;He edges toward us shyly.&nbsp; Does
he mean that she saved him by burning that book?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That book? what book did she burn?&rdquo;&nbsp; The
girl quickly turned her face to him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hasn&rsquo;t he told you then?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not a word.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then he doesn&rsquo;t tell you everything!&rdquo;&nbsp;
Paul had guessed that she pretty much supposed he did.&nbsp; The
great man had now resumed his course and come nearer; in spite of
which his more qualified admirer risked a profane observation:
&ldquo;St. George and the Dragon is what the anecdote
suggests!&rdquo;</p>
<p>His companion, however, didn&rsquo;t hear it; she smiled at
the dragon&rsquo;s adversary.&nbsp; &ldquo;He <i>is</i>
eager&mdash;he is!&rdquo; she insisted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Eager for you&mdash;yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But meanwhile she had called out: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure you
want to know Mr. Overt.&nbsp; You&rsquo;ll be great friends, and
it will always be delightful to me to remember I was here when
you first met and that I had something to do with it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was a freshness of intention in the words that carried
them off; nevertheless our young man was sorry for Henry St.
George, as he was sorry at any time for any person publicly
invited to be responsive and delightful.&nbsp; He would have been
so touched to believe that a man he deeply admired should care a
straw for him that he wouldn&rsquo;t play with such a presumption
if it were possibly vain.&nbsp; In a single glance of the eye of
the pardonable Master he read&mdash;having the sort of divination
that belonged to his talent&mdash;that this personage had ever a
store of friendly patience, which was part of his rich outfit,
but was versed in no printed page of a rising scribbler.&nbsp;
There was even a relief, a simplification, in that: liking him so
much already for what he had done, how could one have liked him
any more for a perception which must at the best have been
vague?&nbsp; Paul Overt got up, trying to show his compassion,
but at the same instant he found himself encompassed by St.
George&rsquo;s happy personal art&mdash;a manner of which it was
the essence to conjure away false positions.&nbsp; It all took
place in a moment.&nbsp; Paul was conscious that he knew him now,
conscious of his handshake and of the very quality of his hand;
of his face, seen nearer and consequently seen better, of a
general fraternising assurance, and in particular of the
circumstance that St. George didn&rsquo;t dislike him (as yet at
least) for being imposed by a charming but too gushing girl,
attractive enough without such danglers.&nbsp; No irritation at
any rate was reflected in the voice with which he questioned Miss
Fancourt as to some project of a walk&mdash;a general walk of the
company round the park.&nbsp; He had soon said something to Paul
about a talk&mdash;&ldquo;We must have a tremendous lot of talk;
there are so many things, aren&rsquo;t there?&rdquo;&mdash;but
our friend could see this idea wouldn&rsquo;t in the present case
take very immediate effect.&nbsp; All the same he was extremely
happy, even after the matter of the walk had been
settled&mdash;the three presently passed back to the other part
of the gallery, where it was discussed with several members of
the party; even when, after they had all gone out together, he
found himself for half an hour conjoined with Mrs. St.
George.&nbsp; Her husband had taken the advance with Miss
Fancourt, and this pair were quite out of sight.&nbsp; It was the
prettiest of rambles for a summer afternoon&mdash;a grassy
circuit, of immense extent, skirting the limit of the park
within.&nbsp; The park was completely surrounded by its old
mottled but perfect red wall, which, all the way on their left,
constituted in itself an object of interest.&nbsp; Mrs. St.
George mentioned to him the surprising number of acres thus
enclosed, together with numerous other facts relating to the
property and the family, and the family&rsquo;s other properties:
she couldn&rsquo;t too strongly urge on him the importance of
seeing their other houses.&nbsp; She ran over the names of these
and rang the changes on them with the facility of practice,
making them appear an almost endless list.&nbsp; She had received
Paul Overt very amiably on his breaking ground with her by the
mention of his joy in having just made her husband&rsquo;s
acquaintance, and struck him as so alert and so accommodating a
little woman that he was rather ashamed of his <i>mot</i> about
her to Miss Fancourt; though he reflected that a hundred other
people, on a hundred occasions, would have been sure to make
it.&nbsp; He got on with Ms. St. George, in short, better than he
expected; but this didn&rsquo;t prevent her suddenly becoming
aware that she was faint with fatigue and must take her way back
to the house by the shortest cut.&nbsp; She professed that she
hadn&rsquo;t the strength of a kitten and was a miserable wreck;
a character he had been too preoccupied to discern in her while
he wondered in what sense she could be held to have been the
making of her husband.&nbsp; He had arrived at a glimmering of
the answer when she announced that she must leave him, though
this perception was of course provisional.&nbsp; While he was in
the very act of placing himself at her disposal for the return
the situation underwent a change; Lord Masham had suddenly turned
up, coming back to them, overtaking them, emerging from the
shrubbery&mdash;Overt could scarcely have said how he
appeared&mdash;and Mrs. St. George had protested that she wanted
to be left alone and not to break up the party.&nbsp; A moment
later she was walking off with Lord Masham.&nbsp; Our friend fell
back and joined Lady Watermouth, to whom he presently mentioned
that Mrs. St. George had been obliged to renounce the attempt to
go further.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She oughtn&rsquo;t to have come out at all,&rdquo; her
ladyship rather grumpily remarked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is she so very much of an invalid?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very bad indeed.&rdquo;&nbsp; And his hostess added
with still greater austerity: &ldquo;She oughtn&rsquo;t really to
come to one!&rdquo;&nbsp; He wondered what was implied by this,
and presently gathered that it was not a reflexion on the
lady&rsquo;s conduct or her moral nature: it only represented
that her strength was not equal to her aspirations.</p>
<h2><a name="page39"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
39</span>III</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> smoking-room at Summersoft was
on the scale of the rest of the place; high light commodious and
decorated with such refined old carvings and mouldings that it
seemed rather a bower for ladies who should sit at work at fading
crewels than a parliament of gentlemen smoking strong
cigars.&nbsp; The gentlemen mustered there in considerable force
on the Sunday evening, collecting mainly at one end, in front of
one of the cool fair fireplaces of white marble, the entablature
of which was adorned with a delicate little Italian
&ldquo;subject.&rdquo;&nbsp; There was another in the wall that
faced it, and, thanks to the mild summer night, a fire in
neither; but a nucleus for aggregation was furnished on one side
by a table in the chimney-corner laden with bottles, decanters
and tall tumblers.&nbsp; Paul Overt was a faithless smoker; he
would puff a cigarette for reasons with which tobacco had nothing
to do.&nbsp; This was particularly the case on the occasion of
which I speak; his motive was the vision of a little direct talk
with Henry St. George.&nbsp; The &ldquo;tremendous&rdquo;
communion of which the great man had held out hopes to him
earlier in the day had not yet come off, and this saddened him
considerably, for the party was to go its several ways
immediately after breakfast on the morrow.&nbsp; He had, however,
the disappointment of finding that apparently the author of
&ldquo;Shadowmere&rdquo; was not disposed to prolong his
vigil.&nbsp; He wasn&rsquo;t among the gentlemen assembled when
Paul entered, nor was he one of those who turned up, in bright
habiliments, during the next ten minutes.&nbsp; The young man
waited a little, wondering if he had only gone to put on
something extraordinary; this would account for his delay as well
as contribute further to Overt&rsquo;s impression of his tendency
to do the approved superficial thing.&nbsp; But he didn&rsquo;t
arrive&mdash;he must have been putting on something more
extraordinary than was probable.&nbsp; Our hero gave him up,
feeling a little injured, a little wounded, at this loss of
twenty coveted words.&nbsp; He wasn&rsquo;t angry, but he puffed
his cigarette sighingly, with the sense of something rare
possibly missed.&nbsp; He wandered away with his regret and moved
slowly round the room, looking at the old prints on the
walls.&nbsp; In this attitude he presently felt a hand on his
shoulder and a friendly voice in his ear &ldquo;This is
good.&nbsp; I hoped I should find you.&nbsp; I came down on
purpose.&rdquo;&nbsp; St. George was there without a change of
dress and with a fine face&mdash;his graver one&mdash;to which
our young man all in a flutter responded.&nbsp; He explained that
it was only for the Master&mdash;the idea of a little
talk&mdash;that he had sat up, and that, not finding him, he had
been on the point of going to bed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you know, I don&rsquo;t smoke&mdash;my wife
doesn&rsquo;t let me,&rdquo; said St. George, looking for a place
to sit down.&nbsp; &ldquo;It&rsquo;s very good for me&mdash;very
good for me.&nbsp; Let us take that sofa.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you mean smoking&rsquo;s good for you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No no&mdash;her not letting me.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s a
great thing to have a wife who&rsquo;s so sure of all the things
one can do without.&nbsp; One might never find them out
one&rsquo;s self.&nbsp; She doesn&rsquo;t allow me to touch a
cigarette.&rdquo;&nbsp; They took possession of a sofa at a
distance from the group of smokers, and St. George went on:
&ldquo;Have you got one yourself?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you mean a cigarette?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dear no&mdash;a wife.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No; and yet I&rsquo;d give up my cigarette for
one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;d give up a good deal more than that,&rdquo;
St. George returned.&nbsp; &ldquo;However, you&rsquo;d get a
great deal in return.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s a something to be said
for wives,&rdquo; he added, folding his arms and crossing his
outstretched legs.&nbsp; He declined tobacco altogether and sat
there without returning fire.&nbsp; His companion stopped
smoking, touched by his courtesy; and after all they were out of
the fumes, their sofa was in a far-away corner.&nbsp; It would
have been a mistake, St. George went on, a great mistake for them
to have separated without a little chat; &ldquo;for I know all
about you,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I know you&rsquo;re very
remarkable.&nbsp; You&rsquo;ve written a very distinguished
book.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And how do you know it?&rdquo; Paul asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, my dear fellow, it&rsquo;s in the air, it&rsquo;s
in the papers, it&rsquo;s everywhere.&rdquo;&nbsp; St. George
spoke with the immediate familiarity of a confr&egrave;re&mdash;a
tone that seemed to his neighbour the very rustle of the
laurel.&nbsp; &ldquo;You&rsquo;re on all men&rsquo;s lips and,
what&rsquo;s better, on all women&rsquo;s.&nbsp; And I&rsquo;ve
just been reading your book.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just?&nbsp; You hadn&rsquo;t read it this
afternoon,&rdquo; said Overt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do you know that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think you should know how I know it,&rdquo; the young
man laughed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose Miss Fancourt told you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No indeed&mdash;she led me rather to suppose you
had.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes&mdash;that&rsquo;s much more what she&rsquo;d
do.&nbsp; Doesn&rsquo;t she shed a rosy glow over life?&nbsp; But
you didn&rsquo;t believe her?&rdquo; asked St. George.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, not when you came to us there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did I pretend? did I pretend badly?&rdquo;&nbsp; But
without waiting for an answer to this St. George went on:
&ldquo;You ought always to believe such a girl as
that&mdash;always, always.&nbsp; Some women are meant to be taken
with allowances and reserves; but you must take <i>her</i> just
as she is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I like her very much,&rdquo; said Paul Overt.</p>
<p>Something in his tone appeared to excite on his
companion&rsquo;s part a momentary sense of the absurd; perhaps
it was the air of deliberation attending this judgement.&nbsp;
St. George broke into a laugh to reply.&nbsp; &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
the best thing you can do with her.&nbsp; She&rsquo;s a rare
young lady!&nbsp; In point of fact, however, I confess I
hadn&rsquo;t read you this afternoon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you see how right I was in this particular case
not to believe Miss Fancourt.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How right? how can I agree to that when I lost credit
by it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you wish to pass exactly for what she represents
you?&nbsp; Certainly you needn&rsquo;t be afraid,&rdquo; Paul
said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, my dear young man, don&rsquo;t talk about
passing&mdash;for the likes of me!&nbsp; I&rsquo;m passing
away&mdash;nothing else than that.&nbsp; She has a better use for
her young imagination (isn&rsquo;t it fine?) than in
&lsquo;representing&rsquo; in any way such a weary wasted used-up
animal!&rdquo;&nbsp; The Master spoke with a sudden sadness that
produced a protest on Paul&rsquo;s part; but before the protest
could be uttered he went on, reverting to the latter&rsquo;s
striking novel: &ldquo;I had no idea you were so good&mdash;one
hears of so many things.&nbsp; But you&rsquo;re surprisingly
good.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to be surprisingly better,&rdquo; Overt
made bold to reply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see that, and it&rsquo;s what fetches me.&nbsp; I
don&rsquo;t see so much else&mdash;as one looks
about&mdash;that&rsquo;s going to be surprisingly better.&nbsp;
They&rsquo;re going to be consistently worse&mdash;most of the
things.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s so much easier to be worse&mdash;heaven
knows I&rsquo;ve found it so.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m not in a great
glow, you know, about what&rsquo;s breaking out all over the
place.&nbsp; But you <i>must</i> be better&mdash;you really must
keep it up.&nbsp; I haven&rsquo;t of course.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s
very difficult&mdash;that&rsquo;s the devil of the whole thing,
keeping it up.&nbsp; But I see you&rsquo;ll be able to.&nbsp; It
will be a great disgrace if you don&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s very interesting to hear you speak of
yourself; but I don&rsquo;t know what you mean by your allusions
to your having fallen off,&rdquo; Paul Overt observed with
pardonable hypocrisy.&nbsp; He liked his companion so much now
that the fact of any decline of talent or of care had ceased for
the moment to be vivid to him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t say that&mdash;don&rsquo;t say that,&rdquo;
St. George returned gravely, his head resting on the top of the
sofa-back and his eyes on the ceiling.&nbsp; &ldquo;You know
perfectly what I mean.&nbsp; I haven&rsquo;t read twenty pages of
your book without seeing that you can&rsquo;t help it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You make me very miserable,&rdquo; Paul ecstatically
breathed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad of that, for it may serve as a kind of
warning.&nbsp; Shocking enough it must be, especially to a young
fresh mind, full of faith&mdash;the spectacle of a man meant for
better things sunk at my age in such dishonour.&rdquo;&nbsp; St.
George, in the same contemplative attitude, spoke softly but
deliberately, and without perceptible emotion.&nbsp; His tone
indeed suggested an impersonal lucidity that was practically
cruel&mdash;cruel to himself&mdash;and made his young friend lay
an argumentative hand on his arm.&nbsp; But he went on while his
eyes seemed to follow the graces of the eighteenth-century
ceiling: &ldquo;Look at me well, take my lesson to
heart&mdash;for it <i>is</i> a lesson.&nbsp; Let that good come
of it at least that you shudder with your pitiful impression, and
that this may help to keep you straight in the future.&nbsp;
Don&rsquo;t become in your old age what I have in mine&mdash;the
depressing, the deplorable illustration of the worship of false
gods!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you mean by your old age?&rdquo; the young man
asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It has made me old.&nbsp; But I like your
youth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Paul answered nothing&mdash;they sat for a minute in
silence.&nbsp; They heard the others going on about the
governmental majority.&nbsp; Then &ldquo;What do you mean by
false gods?&rdquo; he enquired.</p>
<p>His companion had no difficulty whatever in saying, &ldquo;The
idols of the market; money and luxury and &lsquo;the
world;&rsquo; placing one&rsquo;s children and dressing
one&rsquo;s wife; everything that drives one to the short and
easy way.&nbsp; Ah the vile things they make one do!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But surely one&rsquo;s right to want to place
one&rsquo;s children.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;One has no business to have any children,&rdquo; St.
George placidly declared.&nbsp; &ldquo;I mean of course if one
wants to do anything good.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But aren&rsquo;t they an inspiration&mdash;an
incentive?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;An incentive to damnation, artistically
speaking.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You touch on very deep things&mdash;things I should
like to discuss with you,&rdquo; Paul said.&nbsp; &ldquo;I should
like you to tell me volumes about yourself.&nbsp; This is a great
feast for <i>me</i>!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course it is, cruel youth.&nbsp; But to show you
I&rsquo;m still not incapable, degraded as I am, of an act of
faith, I&rsquo;ll tie my vanity to the stake for you and burn it
to ashes.&nbsp; You must come and see me&mdash;you must come and
see us,&rdquo; the Master quickly substituted.&nbsp; &ldquo;Mrs.
St. George is charming; I don&rsquo;t know whether you&rsquo;ve
had any opportunity to talk with her.&nbsp; She&rsquo;ll be
delighted to see you; she likes great celebrities, whether
incipient or predominant.&nbsp; You must come and dine&mdash;my
wife will write to you.&nbsp; Where are you to be
found?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is my little address&rdquo;&mdash;and Overt drew
out his pocketbook and extracted a visiting-card.&nbsp; On second
thoughts, however, he kept it back, remarking that he
wouldn&rsquo;t trouble his friend to take charge of it but would
come and see him straightway in London and leave it at his door
if he should fail to obtain entrance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah you&rsquo;ll probably fail; my wife&rsquo;s always
out&mdash;or when she isn&rsquo;t out is knocked up from having
been out.&nbsp; You must come and dine&mdash;though that
won&rsquo;t do much good either, for my wife insists on big
dinners.&rdquo;&nbsp; St. George turned it over further, but then
went on: &ldquo;You must come down and see us in the country,
that&rsquo;s the best way; we&rsquo;ve plenty of room, and it
isn&rsquo;t bad.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve a house in the country?&rdquo; Paul asked
enviously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah not like this!&nbsp; But we have a sort of place we
go to&mdash;an hour from Euston.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s one of the
reasons.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;One of the reasons?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why my books are so bad.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You must tell me all the others!&rdquo; Paul longingly
laughed.</p>
<p>His friend made no direct rejoinder to this, but spoke again
abruptly.&nbsp; &ldquo;Why have I never seen you
before?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The tone of the question was singularly flattering to our
hero, who felt it to imply the great man&rsquo;s now perceiving
he had for years missed something.&nbsp; &ldquo;Partly, I
suppose, because there has been no particular reason why you
should see me.&nbsp; I haven&rsquo;t lived in the world&mdash;in
your world.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve spent many years out of England, in
different places abroad.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, please don&rsquo;t do it any more.&nbsp; You must
do England&mdash;there&rsquo;s such a lot of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you mean I must write about it?&rdquo; and Paul
struck the note of the listening candour of a child.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course you must.&nbsp; And tremendously well, do you
mind?&nbsp; That takes off a little of my esteem for this thing
of yours&mdash;that it goes on abroad.&nbsp; Hang
&lsquo;abroad!&rsquo;&nbsp; Stay at home and do things
here&mdash;do subjects we can measure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll do whatever you tell me,&rdquo; Overt said,
deeply attentive.&nbsp; &ldquo;But pardon me if I say I
don&rsquo;t understand how you&rsquo;ve been reading my
book,&rdquo; he added.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve had you before me
all the afternoon, first in that long walk, then at tea on the
lawn, till we went to dress for dinner, and all the evening at
dinner and in this place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>St. George turned his face about with a smile.&nbsp; &ldquo;I
gave it but a quarter of an hour.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A quarter of an hour&rsquo;s immense, but I don&rsquo;t
understand where you put it in.&nbsp; In the drawing-room after
dinner you weren&rsquo;t reading&mdash;you were talking to Miss
Fancourt.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It comes to the same thing, because we talked about
&lsquo;Ginistrella.&rsquo;&nbsp; She described it to me&mdash;she
lent me her copy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lent it to you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She travels with it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s incredible,&rdquo; Paul blushed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s glorious for you, but it also turned out
very well for me.&nbsp; When the ladies went off to bed she
kindly offered to send the book down to me.&nbsp; Her maid
brought it to me in the hall and I went to my room with it.&nbsp;
I hadn&rsquo;t thought of coming here, I do that so little.&nbsp;
But I don&rsquo;t sleep early, I always have to read an hour or
two.&nbsp; I sat down to your novel on the spot, without
undressing, without taking off anything but my coat.&nbsp; I
think that&rsquo;s a sign my curiosity had been strongly roused
about it.&nbsp; I read a quarter of an hour, as I tell you, and
even in a quarter of an hour I was greatly struck.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah the beginning isn&rsquo;t very good&mdash;it&rsquo;s
the whole thing!&rdquo; said Overt, who had listened to this
recital with extreme interest.&nbsp; &ldquo;And you laid down the
book and came after me?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the way it moved me.&nbsp; I said to
myself &lsquo;I see it&rsquo;s off his own bat, and he&rsquo;s
there, by the way, and the day&rsquo;s over and I haven&rsquo;t
said twenty words to him.&rsquo;&nbsp; It occurred to me that
you&rsquo;d probably be in the smoking-room and that it
wouldn&rsquo;t be too late to repair my omission.&nbsp; I wanted
to do something civil to you, so I put on my coat and came
down.&nbsp; I shall read your book again when I go up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Our friend faced round in his place&mdash;he was touched as he
had scarce ever been by the picture of such a demonstration in
his favour.&nbsp; &ldquo;You&rsquo;re really the kindest of
men.&nbsp; Cela s&rsquo;est pass&eacute; comme
&ccedil;a?&mdash;and I&rsquo;ve been sitting here with you all
this time and never apprehended it and never thanked
you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank Miss Fancourt&mdash;it was she who wound me
up.&nbsp; She has made me feel as if I had read your
novel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s an angel from heaven!&rdquo; Paul
declared.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She is indeed.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve never seen any one like
her.&nbsp; Her interest in literature&rsquo;s
touching&mdash;something quite peculiar to herself; she takes it
all so seriously.&nbsp; She feels the arts and she wants to feel
them more.&nbsp; To those who practise them it&rsquo;s almost
humiliating&mdash;her curiosity, her sympathy, her good
faith.&nbsp; How can anything be as fine as she supposes
it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s a rare organisation,&rdquo; the younger man
sighed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The richest I&rsquo;ve ever seen&mdash;an artistic
intelligence really of the first order.&nbsp; And lodged in such
a form!&rdquo; St. George exclaimed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One would like to represent such a girl as that,&rdquo;
Paul continued.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah there it is&mdash;there&rsquo;s nothing like
life!&rdquo; said his companion.&nbsp; &ldquo;When you&rsquo;re
finished, squeezed dry and used up and you think the sack&rsquo;s
empty, you&rsquo;re still appealed to, you still get touches and
thrills, the idea springs up&mdash;out of the lap of the
actual&mdash;and shows you there&rsquo;s always something to be
done.&nbsp; But I shan&rsquo;t do it&mdash;she&rsquo;s not for
me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do you mean, not for you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh it&rsquo;s all over&mdash;she&rsquo;s for you, if
you like.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah much less!&rdquo; said Paul.&nbsp;
&ldquo;She&rsquo;s not for a dingy little man of letters;
she&rsquo;s for the world, the bright rich world of bribes and
rewards.&nbsp; And the world will take hold of her&mdash;it will
carry her away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It will try&mdash;but it&rsquo;s just a case in which
there may be a fight.&nbsp; It would be worth fighting, for a man
who had it in him, with youth and talent on his side.&rdquo;</p>
<p>These words rang not a little in Paul Overt&rsquo;s
consciousness&mdash;they held him briefly silent.&nbsp;
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a wonder she has remained as she is; giving
herself away so&mdash;with so much to give away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Remaining, you mean, so ingenuous&mdash;so
natural?&nbsp; Oh she doesn&rsquo;t care a straw&mdash;she gives
away because she overflows.&nbsp; She has her own feelings, her
own standards; she doesn&rsquo;t keep remembering that she must
be proud.&nbsp; And then she hasn&rsquo;t been here long enough
to be spoiled; she has picked up a fashion or two, but only the
amusing ones.&nbsp; She&rsquo;s a provincial&mdash;a provincial
of genius,&rdquo; St. George went on; &ldquo;her very blunders
are charming, her mistakes are interesting.&nbsp; She has come
back from Asia with all sorts of excited curiosities and
unappeased appetities.&nbsp; She&rsquo;s first-rate herself and
she expends herself on the second-rate.&nbsp; She&rsquo;s life
herself and she takes a rare interest in imitations.&nbsp; She
mixes all things up, but there are none in regard to which she
hasn&rsquo;t perceptions.&nbsp; She sees things in a
perspective&mdash;as if from the top of the Himalayas&mdash;and
she enlarges everything she touches.&nbsp; Above all she
exaggerates&mdash;to herself, I mean.&nbsp; She exaggerates you
and me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was nothing in that description to allay the agitation
caused in our younger friend by such a sketch of a fine
subject.&nbsp; It seemed to him to show the art of St.
George&rsquo;s admired hand, and he lost himself in gazing at the
vision&mdash;this hovered there before him&mdash;of a
woman&rsquo;s figure which should be part of the glory of a
novel.&nbsp; But at the end of a moment the thing had turned into
smoke, and out of the smoke&mdash;the last puff of a big
cigar&mdash;proceeded the voice of General Fancourt, who had left
the others and come and planted himself before the gentlemen on
the sofa.&nbsp; &ldquo;I suppose that when you fellows get
talking you sit up half the night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Half the night?&mdash;jamais de la vie!&nbsp; I follow
a hygiene&rdquo;&mdash;and St. George rose to his feet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see&mdash;you&rsquo;re hothouse plants,&rdquo;
laughed the General.&nbsp; &ldquo;That&rsquo;s the way you
produce your flowers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I produce mine between ten and one every
morning&mdash;I bloom with a regularity!&rdquo; St. George went
on.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And with a splendour!&rdquo; added the polite General,
while Paul noted how little the author of
&ldquo;Shadowmere&rdquo; minded, as he phrased it to himself,
when addressed as a celebrated story-teller.&nbsp; The young man
had an idea <i>he</i> should never get used to that; it would
always make him uncomfortable&mdash;from the suspicion that
people would think they had to&mdash;and he would want to prevent
it.&nbsp; Evidently his great colleague had toughened and
hardened&mdash;had made himself a surface.&nbsp; The group of men
had finished their cigars and taken up their bedroom
candlesticks; but before they all passed out Lord Watermouth
invited the pair of guests who had been so absorbed together to
&ldquo;have&rdquo; something.&nbsp; It happened that they both
declined; upon which General Fancourt said: &ldquo;Is that the
hygiene?&nbsp; You don&rsquo;t water the flowers?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh I should drown them!&rdquo; St. George replied; but,
leaving the room still at his young friend&rsquo;s side, he added
whimsically, for the latter&rsquo;s benefit, in a lower tone:
&ldquo;My wife doesn&rsquo;t let me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well I&rsquo;m glad I&rsquo;m not one of you
fellows!&rdquo; the General richly concluded.</p>
<p>The nearness of Summersoft to London had this consequence,
chilling to a person who had had a vision of sociability in a
railway-carriage, that most of the company, after breakfast,
drove back to town, entering their own vehicles, which had come
out to fetch them, while their servants returned by train with
their luggage.&nbsp; Three or four young men, among whom was Paul
Overt, also availed themselves of the common convenience; but
they stood in the portico of the house and saw the others roll
away.&nbsp; Miss Fancourt got into a victoria with her father
after she had shaken hands with our hero and said, smiling in the
frankest way in the world, &ldquo;I <i>must</i> see you
more.&nbsp; Mrs. St. George is so nice: she has promised to ask
us both to dinner together.&rdquo;&nbsp; This lady and her
husband took their places in a perfectly-appointed
brougham&mdash;she required a closed carriage&mdash;and as our
young man waved his hat to them in response to their nods and
flourishes he reflected that, taken together, they were an
honourable image of success, of the material rewards and the
social credit of literature.&nbsp; Such things were not the full
measure, but he nevertheless felt a little proud for
literature.</p>
<h2><a name="page56"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
56</span>IV</h2>
<p>Before a week had elapsed he met Miss Fancourt in Bond Street,
at a private view of the works of a young artist in
&ldquo;black-and-white&rdquo; who had been so good as to invite
him to the stuffy scene.&nbsp; The drawings were admirable, but
the crowd in the one little room was so dense that he felt
himself up to his neck in a sack of wool.&nbsp; A fringe of
people at the outer edge endeavoured by curving forward their
backs and presenting, below them, a still more convex surface of
resistance to the pressure of the mass, to preserve an interval
between their noses and the glazed mounts of the pictures; while
the central body, in the comparative gloom projected by a wide
horizontal screen hung under the skylight and allowing only a
margin for the day, remained upright dense and vague, lost in the
contemplation of its own ingredients.&nbsp; This contemplation
sat especially in the sad eyes of certain female heads,
surmounted with hats of strange convolution and plumage, which
rose on long necks above the others.&nbsp; One of the heads Paul
perceived, was much the so most beautiful of the collection, and
his next discovery was that it belonged to Miss Fancourt.&nbsp;
Its beauty was enhanced by the glad smile she sent him across
surrounding obstructions, a smile that drew him to her as fast as
he could make his way.&nbsp; He had seen for himself at
Summersoft that the last thing her nature contained was an
affectation of indifference; yet even with this circumspection he
took a fresh satisfaction in her not having pretended to await
his arrival with composure.&nbsp; She smiled as radiantly as if
she wished to make him hurry, and as soon as he came within
earshot she broke out in her voice of joy: &ldquo;He&rsquo;s
here&mdash;he&rsquo;s here&mdash;he&rsquo;s coming back in a
moment!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah your father?&rdquo; Paul returned as she offered him
her hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh dear no, this isn&rsquo;t in my poor father&rsquo;s
line.&nbsp; I mean Mr. St. George.&nbsp; He has just left me to
speak to some one&mdash;he&rsquo;s coming back.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s
he who brought me&mdash;wasn&rsquo;t it charming?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah that gives him a pull over me&mdash;I couldn&rsquo;t
have &lsquo;brought&rsquo; you, could I?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you had been so kind as to propose it&mdash;why not
you as well as he?&rdquo; the girl returned with a face that,
expressing no cheap coquetry, simply affirmed a happy fact.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why he&rsquo;s a p&egrave;re de famille.&nbsp;
They&rsquo;ve privileges,&rdquo; Paul explained.&nbsp; And then
quickly: &ldquo;Will you go to see places with <i>me</i>?&rdquo;
he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Anything you like!&rdquo; she smiled.&nbsp; &ldquo;I
know what you mean, that girls have to have a lot of
people&mdash;&rdquo;&nbsp; Then she broke off: &ldquo;I
don&rsquo;t know; I&rsquo;m free.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve always been
like that&mdash;I can go about with any one.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m so
glad to meet you,&rdquo; she added with a sweet distinctness that
made those near her turn round.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let me at least repay that speech by taking you out of
this squash,&rdquo; her friend said.&nbsp; &ldquo;Surely people
aren&rsquo;t happy here!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, they&rsquo;re awfully mornes, aren&rsquo;t
they?&nbsp; But I&rsquo;m very happy indeed and I promised Mr.
St. George to remain in this spot till he comes back.&nbsp;
He&rsquo;s going to take me away.&nbsp; They send him invitations
for things of this sort&mdash;more than he wants.&nbsp; It was so
kind of him to think of me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They also send me invitations of this kind&mdash;more
than <i>I</i> want.&nbsp; And if thinking of <i>you</i> will do
it&mdash;!&rdquo; Paul went on.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh I delight in them&mdash;everything that&rsquo;s
life&mdash;everything that&rsquo;s London!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They don&rsquo;t have private views in Asia, I
suppose,&rdquo; he laughed.&nbsp; &ldquo;But what a pity that for
this year, even in this gorged city, they&rsquo;re pretty well
over.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, next year will do, for I hope you believe
we&rsquo;re going to be friends always.&nbsp; Here he
comes!&rdquo; Miss Fancourt continued before Paul had time to
respond.</p>
<p>He made out St. George in the gaps of the crowd, and this
perhaps led to his hurrying a little to say: &ldquo;I hope that
doesn&rsquo;t mean I&rsquo;m to wait till next year to see
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no&mdash;aren&rsquo;t we to meet at dinner on the
twenty-fifth?&rdquo; she panted with an eagerness as happy as his
own.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s almost next year.&nbsp; Is there no means
of seeing you before?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She stared with all her brightness.&nbsp; &ldquo;Do you mean
you&rsquo;d <i>come</i>?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Like a shot, if you&rsquo;ll be so good as to ask
me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;On Sunday then&mdash;this next Sunday?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What have I done that you should doubt it?&rdquo; the
young man asked with delight.</p>
<p>Miss Fancourt turned instantly to St. George, who had now
joined them, and announced triumphantly: &ldquo;He&rsquo;s coming
on Sunday&mdash;this next Sunday!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah my day&mdash;my day too!&rdquo; said the famous
novelist, laughing, to their companion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, but not yours only.&nbsp; You shall meet in
Manchester Square; you shall talk&mdash;you shall be
wonderful!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t meet often enough,&rdquo; St. George
allowed, shaking hands with his disciple.&nbsp; &ldquo;Too many
things&mdash;ah too many things!&nbsp; But we must make it up in
the country in September.&nbsp; You won&rsquo;t forget
you&rsquo;ve promised me that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why he&rsquo;s coming on the
twenty-fifth&mdash;you&rsquo;ll see him then,&rdquo; said the
girl.</p>
<p>&ldquo;On the twenty-fifth?&rdquo; St. George asked
vaguely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We dine with you; I hope you haven&rsquo;t
forgotten.&nbsp; He&rsquo;s dining out that day,&rdquo; she added
gaily to Paul.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh bless me, yes&mdash;that&rsquo;s charming!&nbsp; And
you&rsquo;re coming?&nbsp; My wife didn&rsquo;t tell me,&rdquo;
St. George said to him.&nbsp; &ldquo;Too many things&mdash;too
many things!&rdquo; he repeated.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Too many people&mdash;too many people!&rdquo; Paul
exclaimed, giving ground before the penetration of an elbow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You oughtn&rsquo;t to say that.&nbsp; They all read
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Me?&nbsp; I should like to see them!&nbsp; Only two or
three at most,&rdquo; the young man returned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you ever hear anything like that?&nbsp; He knows,
haughtily, how good he is!&rdquo; St. George declared, laughing
to Miss Fancourt.&nbsp; &ldquo;They read <i>me</i>, but that
doesn&rsquo;t make me like them any better.&nbsp; Come away from
them, come away!&rdquo;&nbsp; And he led the way out of the
exhibition.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s going to take me to the Park,&rdquo; Miss
Fancourt observed to Overt with elation as they passed along the
corridor that led to the street.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah does he go there?&rdquo; Paul asked, taking the fact
for a somewhat unexpected illustration of St. George&rsquo;s
moeurs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a beautiful day&mdash;there&rsquo;ll be a
great crowd.&nbsp; We&rsquo;re going to look at the people, to
look at types,&rdquo; the girl went on.&nbsp; &ldquo;We shall sit
under the trees; we shall walk by the Row.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I go once a year&mdash;on business,&rdquo; said St.
George, who had overheard Paul&rsquo;s question.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Or with a country cousin, didn&rsquo;t you tell
me?&nbsp; I&rsquo;m the country cousin!&rdquo; she continued over
her shoulder to Paul as their friend drew her toward a hansom to
which he had signalled.&nbsp; The young man watched them get in;
he returned, as he stood there, the friendly wave of the hand
with which, ensconced in the vehicle beside her, St. George took
leave of him.&nbsp; He even lingered to see the vehicle start
away and lose itself in the confusion of Bond Street.&nbsp; He
followed it with his eyes; it put to him embarrassing
things.&nbsp; &ldquo;She&rsquo;s not for <i>me</i>!&rdquo; the
great novelist had said emphatically at Summersoft; but his
manner of conducting himself toward her appeared not quite in
harmony with such a conviction.&nbsp; How could he have behaved
differently if she <i>had</i> been for him?&nbsp; An indefinite
envy rose in Paul Overt&rsquo;s heart as he took his way on foot
alone; a feeling addressed alike strangely enough, to each of the
occupants of the hansom.&nbsp; How much he should like to rattle
about London with such a girl!&nbsp; How much he should like to
go and look at &ldquo;types&rdquo; with St. George!</p>
<p>The next Sunday at four o&rsquo;clock he called in Manchester
Square, where his secret wish was gratified by his finding Miss
Fancourt alone.&nbsp; She was in a large bright friendly occupied
room, which was painted red all over, draped with the quaint
cheap florid stuffs that are represented as coming from southern
and eastern countries, where they are fabled to serve as the
counterpanes of the peasantry, and bedecked with pottery of vivid
hues, ranged on casual shelves, and with many water-colour
drawings from the hand (as the visitor learned) of the young lady
herself, commemorating with a brave breadth the sunsets, the
mountains, the temples and palaces of India.&nbsp; He sat an
hour&mdash;more than an hour, two hours&mdash;and all the while
no one came in.&nbsp; His hostess was so good as to remark, with
her liberal humanity, that it was delightful they weren&rsquo;t
interrupted; it was so rare in London, especially at that season,
that people got a good talk.&nbsp; But luckily now, of a fine
Sunday, half the world went out of town, and that made it better
for those who didn&rsquo;t go, when these others were in
sympathy.&nbsp; It was the defect of London&mdash;one of two or
three, the very short list of those she recognised in the teeming
world-city she adored&mdash;that there were too few good chances
for talk; you never had time to carry anything far.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Too many things&mdash;too many things!&rdquo; Paul
said, quoting St. George&rsquo;s exclamation of a few days
before.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah yes, for him there are too many&mdash;his
life&rsquo;s too complicated.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you seen it <i>near</i>?&nbsp; That&rsquo;s what I
should like to do; it might explain some mysteries,&rdquo; her
visitor went on.&nbsp; She asked him what mysteries he meant, and
he said: &ldquo;Oh peculiarities of his work, inequalities,
superficialities.&nbsp; For one who looks at it from the artistic
point of view it contains a bottomless ambiguity.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She became at this, on the spot, all intensity.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Ah do describe that more&mdash;it&rsquo;s so
interesting.&nbsp; There are no such suggestive questions.&nbsp;
I&rsquo;m so fond of them.&nbsp; He thinks he&rsquo;s a
failure&mdash;fancy!&rdquo; she beautifully wailed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That depends on what his ideal may have been.&nbsp;
With his gifts it ought to have been high.&nbsp; But till one
knows what he really proposed to himself&mdash;?&nbsp; Do
<i>you</i> know by chance?&rdquo; the young man broke off.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh he doesn&rsquo;t talk to me about himself.&nbsp; I
can&rsquo;t make him.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s too provoking.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Paul was on the point of asking what then he did talk about,
but discretion checked it and he said instead: &ldquo;Do you
think he&rsquo;s unhappy at home?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She seemed to wonder.&nbsp; &ldquo;At home?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I mean in his relations with his wife.&nbsp; He has a
mystifying little way of alluding to her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not to me,&rdquo; said Marian Fancourt with her clear
eyes.&nbsp; &ldquo;That wouldn&rsquo;t be right, would it?&rdquo;
she asked gravely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not particularly; so I&rsquo;m glad he doesn&rsquo;t
mention her to you.&nbsp; To praise her might bore you, and he
has no business to do anything else.&nbsp; Yet he knows you
better than me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah but he respects <i>you</i>!&rdquo; the girl cried as
with envy.</p>
<p>Her visitor stared a moment, then broke into a laugh.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Doesn&rsquo;t he respect you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course, but not in the same way.&nbsp; He respects
what you&rsquo;ve done&mdash;he told me so, the other
day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Paul drank it in, but retained his faculties.&nbsp;
&ldquo;When you went to look at types?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes&mdash;we found so many: he has such an observation
of them!&nbsp; He talked a great deal about your book.&nbsp; He
says it&rsquo;s really important.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Important!&nbsp; Ah the grand
creature!&rdquo;&mdash;and the author of the work in question
groaned for joy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He was wonderfully amusing, he was inexpressibly droll,
while we walked about.&nbsp; He sees everything; he has so many
comparisons and images, and they&rsquo;re always exactly
right.&nbsp; C&rsquo;est d&rsquo;un trouv&eacute;, as they
say.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, with his gifts, such things as he ought to have
done!&rdquo; Paul sighed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And don&rsquo;t you think he <i>has</i> done
them?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ah it was just the point.&nbsp; &ldquo;A part of them, and of
course even that part&rsquo;s immense.&nbsp; But he might have
been one of the greatest.&nbsp; However, let us not make this an
hour of qualifications.&nbsp; Even as they stand,&rdquo; our
friend earnestly concluded, &ldquo;his writings are a mine of
gold.&rdquo;</p>
<p>To this proposition she ardently responded, and for half an
hour the pair talked over the Master&rsquo;s principal
productions.&nbsp; She knew them well&mdash;she knew them even
better than her visitor, who was struck with her critical
intelligence and with something large and bold in the movement in
her mind.&nbsp; She said things that startled him and that
evidently had come to her directly; they weren&rsquo;t picked-up
phrases&mdash;she placed them too well.&nbsp; St. George had been
right about her being first-rate, about her not being afraid to
gush, not remembering that she must be proud.&nbsp; Suddenly
something came back to her, and she said: &ldquo;I recollect that
he did speak of Mrs. St. George to me once.&nbsp; He said,
apropos of something or other, that she didn&rsquo;t care for
perfection.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a great crime in an artist&rsquo;s
wife,&rdquo; Paul returned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, poor thing!&rdquo; and the girl sighed with a
suggestion of many reflexions, some of them mitigating.&nbsp; But
she presently added: &ldquo;Ah perfection, perfection&mdash;how
one ought to go in for it!&nbsp; I wish <i>I</i>
could.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Every one can in his way,&rdquo; her companion
opined.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In <i>his</i> way, yes&mdash;but not in hers.&nbsp;
Women are so hampered&mdash;so condemned!&nbsp; Yet it&rsquo;s a
kind of dishonour if you don&rsquo;t, when you want to <i>do</i>
something, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;&nbsp; Miss Fancourt pursued,
dropping one train in her quickness to take up another, an
accident that was common with her.&nbsp; So these two young
persons sat discussing high themes in their eclectic
drawing-room, in their London
&ldquo;season&rdquo;&mdash;discussing, with extreme seriousness,
the high theme of perfection.&nbsp; It must be said in
extenuation of this eccentricity that they were interested in the
business.&nbsp; Their tone had truth and their emotion beauty;
they weren&rsquo;t posturing for each other or for some one
else.</p>
<p>The subject was so wide that they found themselves reducing
it; the perfection to which for the moment they agreed to confine
their speculations was that of the valid, the exemplary work of
art.&nbsp; Our young woman&rsquo;s imagination, it appeared, had
wandered far in that direction, and her guest had the rare
delight of feeling in their conversation a full
interchange.&nbsp; This episode will have lived for years in his
memory and even in his wonder; it had the quality that fortune
distils in a single drop at a time&mdash;the quality that
lubricates many ensuing frictions.&nbsp; He still, whenever he
likes, has a vision of the room, the bright red sociable
talkative room with the curtains that, by a stroke of successful
audacity, had the note of vivid blue.&nbsp; He remembers where
certain things stood, the particular book open on the table and
the almost intense odour of the flowers placed, at the left,
somewhere behind him.&nbsp; These facts were the fringe, as it
were, of a fine special agitation which had its birth in those
two hours and of which perhaps the main sign was in its leading
him inwardly and repeatedly to breathe &ldquo;I had no idea there
was any one like this&mdash;I had no idea there was any one like
this!&rdquo;&nbsp; Her freedom amazed him and charmed
him&mdash;it seemed so to simplify the practical question.&nbsp;
She was on the footing of an independent personage&mdash;a
motherless girl who had passed out of her teens and had a
position and responsibilities, who wasn&rsquo;t held down to the
limitations of a little miss.&nbsp; She came and went with no
dragged duenna, she received people alone, and, though she was
totally without hardness, the question of protection or patronage
had no relevancy in regard to her.&nbsp; She gave such an
impression of the clear and the noble combined with the easy and
the natural that in spite of her eminent modern situation she
suggested no sort of sister-hood with the &ldquo;fast&rdquo;
girl.&nbsp; Modern she was indeed, and made Paul Overt, who loved
old colour, the golden glaze of time, think with some alarm of
the muddled palette of the future.&nbsp; He couldn&rsquo;t get
used to her interest in the arts he cared for; it seemed too good
to be real&mdash;it was so unlikely an adventure to tumble into
such a well of sympathy.&nbsp; One might stray into the desert
easily&mdash;that was on the cards and that was the law of life;
but it was too rare an accident to stumble on a crystal
well.&nbsp; Yet if her aspirations seemed at one moment too
extravagant to be real they struck him at the next as too
intelligent to be false.&nbsp; They were both high and lame, and,
whims for whims, he preferred them to any he had met in a like
relation.&nbsp; It was probable enough she would leave them
behind&mdash;exchange them for politics or
&ldquo;smartness&rdquo; or mere prolific maternity, as was the
custom of scribbling daubing educated flattered girls in an age
of luxury and a society of leisure.&nbsp; He noted that the
water-colours on the walls of the room she sat in had mainly the
quality of being na&iuml;ves, and reflected that
na&iuml;vet&eacute; in art is like a zero in a number: its
importance depends on the figure it is united with.&nbsp;
Meanwhile, however, he had fallen in love with her.&nbsp; Before
he went away, at any rate, he said to her: &ldquo;I thought St.
George was coming to see you to-day, but he doesn&rsquo;t turn
up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For a moment he supposed she was going to cry &ldquo;Comment
donc?&nbsp; Did you come here only to meet him?&rdquo;&nbsp; But
the next he became aware of how little such a speech would have
fallen in with any note of flirtation he had as yet perceived in
her.&nbsp; She only replied: &ldquo;Ah yes, but I don&rsquo;t
think he&rsquo;ll come.&nbsp; He recommended me not to expect
him.&rdquo;&nbsp; Then she gaily but all gently added: &ldquo;He
said it wasn&rsquo;t fair to you.&nbsp; But I think I could
manage two.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So could I,&rdquo; Paul Overt returned, stretching the
point a little to meet her.&nbsp; In reality his appreciation of
the occasion was so completely an appreciation of the woman
before him that another figure in the scene, even so esteemed a
one as St. George, might for the hour have appealed to him
vainly.&nbsp; He left the house wondering what the great man had
meant by its not being fair to him; and, still more than that,
whether he had actually stayed away from the force of that
idea.&nbsp; As he took his course through the Sunday solitude of
Manchester Square, swinging his stick and with a good deal of
emotion fermenting in his soul, it appeared to him he was living
in a world strangely magnanimous.&nbsp; Miss Fancourt had told
him it was possible she should be away, and that her father
should be, on the following Sunday, but that she had the hope of
a visit from him in the other event.&nbsp; She promised to let
him know should their absence fail, and then he might act
accordingly.&nbsp; After he had passed into one of the streets
that open from the Square he stopped, without definite
intentions, looking sceptically for a cab.&nbsp; In a moment he
saw a hansom roll through the place from the other side and come
a part of the way toward him.&nbsp; He was on the point of
hailing the driver when he noticed a &ldquo;fare&rdquo; within;
then he waited, seeing the man prepare to deposit his passenger
by pulling up at one of the houses.&nbsp; The house was
apparently the one he himself had just quitted; at least he drew
that inference as he recognised Henry St. George in the person
who stepped out of the hansom.&nbsp; Paul turned off as quickly
as if he had been caught in the act of spying.&nbsp; He gave up
his cab&mdash;he preferred to walk; he would go nowhere
else.&nbsp; He was glad St. George hadn&rsquo;t renounced his
visit altogether&mdash;that would have been too absurd.&nbsp;
Yes, the world was magnanimous, and even he himself felt so as,
on looking at his watch, he noted but six o&rsquo;clock, so that
he could mentally congratulate his successor on having an hour
still to sit in Miss Fancourt&rsquo;s drawing-room.&nbsp; He
himself might use that hour for another visit, but by the time he
reached the Marble Arch the idea of such a course had become
incongruous to him.&nbsp; He passed beneath that architectural
effort and walked into the Park till he got upon the spreading
grass.&nbsp; Here he continued to walk; he took his way across
the elastic turf and came out by the Serpentine.&nbsp; He watched
with a friendly eye the diversions of the London people, he bent
a glance almost encouraging on the young ladies paddling their
sweethearts about the lake and the guardsmen tickling tenderly
with their bearskins the artificial flowers in the Sunday hats of
their partners.&nbsp; He prolonged his meditative walk; he went
into Kensington Gardens, he sat upon the penny chairs, he looked
at the little sail-boats launched upon the round pond and was
glad he had no engagement to dine.&nbsp; He repaired for this
purpose, very late, to his club, where he found himself unable to
order a repast and told the waiter to bring whatever there
was.&nbsp; He didn&rsquo;t even observe what he was served with,
and he spent the evening in the library of the establishment,
pretending to read an article in an American magazine.&nbsp; He
failed to discover what it was about; it appeared in a dim way to
be about Marian Fancourt.</p>
<p>Quite late in the week she wrote to him that she was not to go
into the country&mdash;it had only just been settled.&nbsp; Her
father, she added, would never settle anything, but put it all on
her.&nbsp; She felt her responsibility&mdash;she had to&mdash;and
since she was forced this was the way she had decided.&nbsp; She
mentioned no reasons, which gave our friend all the clearer field
for bold conjecture about them.&nbsp; In Manchester Square on
this second Sunday he esteemed his fortune less good, for she had
three or four other visitors.&nbsp; But there were three or four
compensations; perhaps the greatest of which was that, learning
how her father had after all, at the last hour, gone out of town
alone, the bold conjecture I just now spoke of found itself
becoming a shade more bold.&nbsp; And then her presence was her
presence, and the personal red room was there and was full of it,
whatever phantoms passed and vanished, emitting incomprehensible
sounds.&nbsp; Lastly, he had the resource of staying till every
one had come and gone and of believing this grateful to her,
though she gave no particular sign.&nbsp; When they were alone
together he came to his point.&nbsp; &ldquo;But St. George did
come&mdash;last Sunday.&nbsp; I saw him as I looked
back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes; but it was the last time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The last time?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He said he would never come again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Paul Overt stared.&nbsp; &ldquo;Does he mean he wishes to
cease to see you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what he means,&rdquo; the girl
bravely smiled.&nbsp; &ldquo;He won&rsquo;t at any rate see me
here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And pray why not?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t the least idea,&rdquo; said Marian
Fancourt, whose visitor found her more perversely sublime than
ever yet as she professed this clear helplessness.</p>
<h2><a name="page74"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 74</span>V</h2>
<p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Oh</span> I say, I want you to stop
a little,&rdquo; Henry St. George said to him at eleven
o&rsquo;clock the night he dined with the head of the
profession.&nbsp; The company&mdash;none of it indeed <i>of</i>
the profession&mdash;had been numerous and was taking its leave;
our young man, after bidding good-night to his hostess, had put
out his hand in farewell to the master of the house.&nbsp;
Besides drawing from the latter the protest I have cited this
movement provoked a further priceless word about their chance now
to have a talk, their going into his room, his having still
everything to say.&nbsp; Paul Overt was all delight at this
kindness; nevertheless he mentioned in weak jocose qualification
the bare fact that he had promised to go to another place which
was at a considerable distance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well then you&rsquo;ll break your promise, that&rsquo;s
all.&nbsp; You quite awful humbug!&rdquo; St. George added in a
tone that confirmed our young man&rsquo;s ease.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly I&rsquo;ll break it&mdash;but it was a real
promise.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you mean to Miss Fancourt?&nbsp; You&rsquo;re
following her?&rdquo; his friend asked.</p>
<p>He answered by a question.&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh is <i>she</i>
going?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Base impostor!&rdquo; his ironic host went on.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve treated you handsomely on the article of that
young lady: I won&rsquo;t make another concession.&nbsp; Wait
three minutes&mdash;I&rsquo;ll be with you.&rdquo;&nbsp; He gave
himself to his departing guests, accompanied the long-trained
ladies to the door.&nbsp; It was a hot night, the windows were
open, the sound of the quick carriages and of the linkmen&rsquo;s
call came into the house.&nbsp; The affair had rather glittered;
a sense of festal things was in the heavy air: not only the
influence of that particular entertainment, but the suggestion of
the wide hurry of pleasure which in London on summer nights fills
so many of the happier quarters of the complicated town.&nbsp;
Gradually Mrs. St. George&rsquo;s drawing-room emptied itself;
Paul was left alone with his hostess, to whom he explained the
motive of his waiting.&nbsp; &ldquo;Ah yes, some intellectual,
some <i>professional</i>, talk,&rdquo; she leered; &ldquo;at this
season doesn&rsquo;t one miss it?&nbsp; Poor dear Henry,
I&rsquo;m so glad!&rdquo;&nbsp; The young man looked out of the
window a moment, at the called hansoms that lurched up, at the
smooth broughams that rolled away.&nbsp; When he turned round
Mrs. St. George had disappeared; her husband&rsquo;s voice rose
to him from below&mdash;he was laughing and talking, in the
portico, with some lady who awaited her carriage.&nbsp; Paul had
solitary possession, for some minutes, of the warm deserted rooms
where the covered tinted lamplight was soft, the seats had been
pushed about and the odour of flowers lingered.&nbsp; They were
large, they were pretty, they contained objects of value;
everything in the picture told of a &ldquo;good
house.&rdquo;&nbsp; At the end of five minutes a servant came in
with a request from the Master that he would join him downstairs;
upon which, descending, he followed his conductor through a long
passage to an apartment thrown out, in the rear of the
habitation, for the special requirements, as he guessed, of a
busy man of letters.</p>
<p>St. George was in his shirt-sleeves in the middle of a large
high room&mdash;a room without windows, but with a wide skylight
at the top, that of a place of exhibition.&nbsp; It was furnished
as a library, and the serried bookshelves rose to the ceiling, a
surface of incomparable tone produced by dimly-gilt
&ldquo;backs&rdquo; interrupted here and there by the suspension
of old prints and drawings.&nbsp; At the end furthest from the
door of admission was a tall desk, of great extent, at which the
person using it could write only in the erect posture of a clerk
in a counting-house; and stretched from the entrance to this
structure was a wide plain band of crimson cloth, as straight as
a garden-path and almost as long, where, in his mind&rsquo;s eye,
Paul at once beheld the Master pace to and fro during vexed
hours&mdash;hours, that is, of admirable composition.&nbsp; The
servant gave him a coat, an old jacket with a hang of experience,
from a cupboard in the wall, retiring afterwards with the garment
he had taken off.&nbsp; Paul Overt welcomed the coat; it was a
coat for talk, it promised confidences&mdash;having visibly
received so many&mdash;and had tragic literary elbows.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Ah we&rsquo;re practical&mdash;we&rsquo;re
practical!&rdquo; St. George said as he saw his visitor look the
place over.&nbsp; &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it a good big cage for going
round and round?&nbsp; My wife invented it and she locks me up
here every morning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Our young man breathed&mdash;by way of tribute&mdash;with a
certain oppression.&nbsp; &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t miss a
window&mdash;a place to look out?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I did at first awfully; but her calculation was
just.&nbsp; It saves time, it has saved me many months in these
ten years.&nbsp; Here I stand, under the eye of day&mdash;in
London of course, very often, it&rsquo;s rather a bleared old
eye&mdash;walled in to my trade.&nbsp; I can&rsquo;t get
away&mdash;so the room&rsquo;s a fine lesson in
concentration.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve learnt the lesson, I think; look
at that big bundle of proof and acknowledge it.&rdquo;&nbsp; He
pointed to a fat roll of papers, on one of the tables, which had
not been undone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you bringing out another&mdash;?&rdquo; Paul asked
in a tone the fond deficiencies of which he didn&rsquo;t
recognise till his companion burst out laughing, and indeed
scarce even then.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You humbug, you humbug!&rdquo;&mdash;St. George
appeared to enjoy caressing him, as it were, with that
opprobrium.&nbsp; &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t I know what you think of
them?&rdquo; he asked, standing there with his hands in his
pockets and with a new kind of smile.&nbsp; It was as if he were
going to let his young votary see him all now.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Upon my word in that case you know more than I
do!&rdquo; the latter ventured to respond, revealing a part of
the torment of being able neither clearly to esteem nor
distinctly to renounce him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear fellow,&rdquo; said the more and more
interesting Master, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t imagine I talk about my
books specifically; they&rsquo;re not a decent subject&mdash;il
ne manquerait plus que &ccedil;a!&nbsp; I&rsquo;m not so bad as
you may apprehend!&nbsp; About myself, yes, a little, if you
like; though it wasn&rsquo;t for that I brought you down
here.&nbsp; I want to ask you something&mdash;very much indeed; I
value this chance.&nbsp; Therefore sit down.&nbsp; We&rsquo;re
practical, but there <i>is</i> a sofa, you see&mdash;for she does
humour my poor bones so far.&nbsp; Like all really great
administrators and disciplinarians she knows when wisely to
relax.&rdquo;&nbsp; Paul sank into the corner of a deep leathern
couch, but his friend remained standing and explanatory.&nbsp;
&ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t mind, in this room, this is my
habit.&nbsp; From the door to the desk and from the desk to the
door.&nbsp; That shakes up my imagination gently; and don&rsquo;t
you see what a good thing it is that there&rsquo;s no window for
her to fly out of?&nbsp; The eternal standing as I write (I stop
at that bureau and put it down, when anything comes, and so we go
on) was rather wearisome at first, but we adopted it with an eye
to the long run; you&rsquo;re in better order&mdash;if your legs
don&rsquo;t break down!&mdash;and you can keep it up for more
years.&nbsp; Oh we&rsquo;re practical&mdash;we&rsquo;re
practical!&rdquo; St. George repeated, going to the table and
taking up all mechanically the bundle of proofs.&nbsp; But,
pulling off the wrapper, he had a change of attention that
appealed afresh to our hero.&nbsp; He lost himself a moment,
examining the sheets of his new book, while the younger
man&rsquo;s eyes wandered over the room again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lord, what good things I should do if I had such a
charming place as this to do them in!&rdquo; Paul
reflected.&nbsp; The outer world, the world of accident and
ugliness, was so successfully excluded, and within the rich
protecting square, beneath the patronising sky, the
dream-figures, the summoned company, could hold their particular
revel.&nbsp; It was a fond prevision of Overt&rsquo;s rather than
an observation on actual data, for which occasions had been too
few, that the Master thus more closely viewed would have the
quality, the charming gift, of flashing out, all surprisingly, in
personal intercourse and at moments of suspended or perhaps even
of diminished expectation.&nbsp; A happy relation with him would
be a thing proceeding by jumps, not by traceable stages.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you read them&mdash;really?&rdquo; he asked, laying
down the proofs on Paul&rsquo;s enquiring of him how soon the
work would be published.&nbsp; And when the young man answered
&ldquo;Oh yes, always,&rdquo; he was moved to mirth again by
something he caught in his manner of saying that.&nbsp;
&ldquo;You go to see your grandmother on her birthday&mdash;and
very proper it is, especially as she won&rsquo;t last for
ever.&nbsp; She has lost every faculty and every sense; she
neither sees, nor hears, nor speaks; but all customary pieties
and kindly habits are respectable.&nbsp; Only you&rsquo;re strong
if you <i>do</i> read &rsquo;em!&nbsp; <i>I</i> couldn&rsquo;t,
my dear fellow.&nbsp; You are strong, I know; and that&rsquo;s
just a part of what I wanted to say to you.&nbsp; You&rsquo;re
very strong indeed.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve been going into your other
things&mdash;they&rsquo;ve interested me immensely.&nbsp; Some
one ought to have told me about them before&mdash;some one I
could believe.&nbsp; But whom can one believe?&nbsp; You&rsquo;re
wonderfully on the right road&mdash;it&rsquo;s awfully decent
work.&nbsp; Now do you mean to keep it up?&mdash;that&rsquo;s
what I want to ask you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do I mean to do others?&rdquo; Paul asked, looking up
from his sofa at his erect inquisitor and feeling partly like a
happy little boy when the school-master is gay, and partly like
some pilgrim of old who might have consulted a world-famous
oracle.&nbsp; St. George&rsquo;s own performance had been infirm,
but as an adviser he would be infallible.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Others&mdash;others?&nbsp; Ah the number won&rsquo;t
matter; one other would do, if it were really a further
step&mdash;a throb of the same effort.&nbsp; What I mean is have
you it in your heart to go in for some sort of decent
perfection?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah decency, ah perfection&mdash;!&rdquo; the young man
sincerely sighed.&nbsp; &ldquo;I talked of them the other Sunday
with Miss Fancourt.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It produced on the Master&rsquo;s part a laugh of odd
acrimony.&nbsp; &ldquo;Yes, they&rsquo;ll &lsquo;talk&rsquo; of
them as much as you like!&nbsp; But they&rsquo;ll do little to
help one to them.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s no obligation of course;
only you strike me as capable,&rdquo; he went on.&nbsp;
&ldquo;You must have thought it all over.&nbsp; I can&rsquo;t
believe you&rsquo;re without a plan.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s the
sensation you give me, and it&rsquo;s so rare that it really
stirs one up&mdash;it makes you remarkable.&nbsp; If you
haven&rsquo;t a plan, if you <i>don&rsquo;t</i> mean to keep it
up, surely you&rsquo;re within your rights; it&rsquo;s
nobody&rsquo;s business, no one can force you, and not more than
two or three people will notice you don&rsquo;t go
straight.&nbsp; The others&mdash;<i>all</i> the rest, every blest
soul in England, will think you do&mdash;will think you are
keeping it up: upon my honour they will!&nbsp; I shall be one of
the two or three who know better.&nbsp; Now the question is
whether you can do it for two or three.&nbsp; Is that the stuff
you&rsquo;re made of?&rdquo;</p>
<p>It locked his guest a minute as in closed throbbing
arms.&nbsp; &ldquo;I could do it for one, if you were the
one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t say that; I don&rsquo;t deserve it; it
scorches me,&rdquo; he protested with eyes suddenly grave and
glowing.&nbsp; &ldquo;The &lsquo;one&rsquo; is of course
one&rsquo;s self, one&rsquo;s conscience, one&rsquo;s idea, the
singleness of one&rsquo;s aim.&nbsp; I think of that pure spirit
as a man thinks of a woman he has in some detested hour of his
youth loved and forsaken.&nbsp; She haunts him with reproachful
eyes, she lives for ever before him.&nbsp; As an artist, you
know, I&rsquo;ve married for money.&rdquo;&nbsp; Paul stared and
even blushed a little, confounded by this avowal; whereupon his
host, observing the expression of his face, dropped a quick laugh
and pursued: &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t follow my figure.&nbsp;
I&rsquo;m not speaking of my dear wife, who had a small
fortune&mdash;which, however, was not my bribe.&nbsp; I fell in
love with her, as many other people have done.&nbsp; I refer to
the mercenary muse whom I led to the altar of literature.&nbsp;
Don&rsquo;t, my boy, put your nose into <i>that</i> yoke.&nbsp;
The awful jade will lead you a life!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Our hero watched him, wondering and deeply touched.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t you been happy!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Happy?&nbsp; It&rsquo;s a kind of hell.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There are things I should like to ask you,&rdquo; Paul
said after a pause.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ask me anything in all the world.&nbsp; I&rsquo;d turn
myself inside out to save you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To &lsquo;save&rsquo; me?&rdquo; he quavered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To make you stick to it&mdash;to make you see it
through.&nbsp; As I said to you the other night at Summersoft,
let my example be vivid to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why your books are not so bad as that,&rdquo; said
Paul, fairly laughing and feeling that if ever a fellow had
breathed the air of art&mdash;!</p>
<p>&ldquo;So bad as what?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your talent&rsquo;s so great that it&rsquo;s in
everything you do, in what&rsquo;s less good as well as in
what&rsquo;s best.&nbsp; You&rsquo;ve some forty volumes to show
for it&mdash;forty volumes of wonderful life, of rare
observation, of magnificent ability.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m very clever, of course I know
that&rdquo;&mdash;but it was a thing, in fine, this author made
nothing of.&nbsp; &ldquo;Lord, what rot they&rsquo;d all be if I
hadn&rsquo;t been I&rsquo;m a successful charlatan,&rdquo; he
went on&mdash;&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been able to pass off my
system.&nbsp; But do you know what it is?&nbsp; It&rsquo;s
cartonpierre.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Carton-pierre?&rdquo; Paul was struck, and gaped.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lincrusta-Walton!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah don&rsquo;t say such things&mdash;you make me
bleed!&rdquo; the younger man protested.&nbsp; &ldquo;I see you
in a beautiful fortunate home, living in comfort and
honour.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you call it honour?&rdquo;&mdash;his host took him
up with an intonation that often comes back to him.&nbsp;
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what I want <i>you</i> to go in for.&nbsp; I
mean the real thing.&nbsp; This is brummagem.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Brummagem?&rdquo; Paul ejaculated while his eyes
wandered, by a movement natural at the moment, over the luxurious
room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah they make it so well to-day&mdash;it&rsquo;s
wonderfully deceptive!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Our friend thrilled with the interest and perhaps even more
with the pity of it.&nbsp; Yet he wasn&rsquo;t afraid to seem to
patronise when he could still so far envy.&nbsp; &ldquo;Is it
deceptive that I find you living with every appearance of
domestic felicity&mdash;blest with a devoted, accomplished wife,
with children whose acquaintance I haven&rsquo;t yet had the
pleasure of making, but who <i>must</i> be delightful young
people, from what I know of their parents?&rdquo;</p>
<p>St. George smiled as for the candour of his question.&nbsp;
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all excellent, my dear fellow&mdash;heaven
forbid I should deny it.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve made a great deal of
money; my wife has known how to take care of it, to use it
without wasting it, to put a good bit of it by, to make it
fructify.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve got a loaf on the shelf; I&rsquo;ve
got everything in fact but the great thing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The great thing?&rdquo; Paul kept echoing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The sense of having done the best&mdash;the sense which
is the real life of the artist and the absence of which is his
death, of having drawn from his intellectual instrument the
finest music that nature had hidden in it, of having played it as
it should be played.&nbsp; He either does that or he
doesn&rsquo;t&mdash;and if he doesn&rsquo;t he isn&rsquo;t worth
speaking of.&nbsp; Therefore, precisely, those who really know
<i>don&rsquo;t</i> speak of him.&nbsp; He may still hear a great
chatter, but what he hears most is the incorruptible silence of
Fame.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve squared her, you may say, for my little
hour&mdash;but what&rsquo;s my little hour?&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t
imagine for a moment,&rdquo; the Master pursued, &ldquo;that
I&rsquo;m such a cad as to have brought you down here to abuse or
to complain of my wife to you.&nbsp; She&rsquo;s a woman of
distinguished qualities, to whom my obligations are immense; so
that, if you please, we&rsquo;ll say nothing about her.&nbsp; My
boys&mdash;my children are all boys&mdash;are straight and
strong, thank God, and have no poverty of growth about them, no
penury of needs.&nbsp; I receive periodically the most
satisfactory attestation from Harrow, from Oxford, from
Sandhurst&mdash;oh we&rsquo;ve done the best for them!&mdash;of
their eminence as living thriving consuming organisms.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It must be delightful to feel that the son of
one&rsquo;s loins is at Sandhurst,&rdquo; Paul remarked
enthusiastically.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is&mdash;it&rsquo;s charming.&nbsp; Oh I&rsquo;m a
patriot!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The young man then could but have the greater tribute of
questions to pay.&nbsp; &ldquo;Then what did you mean&mdash;the
other night at Summersoft&mdash;by saying that children are a
curse?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear youth, on what basis are we talking?&rdquo; and
St. George dropped upon the sofa at a short distance from
him.&nbsp; Sitting a little sideways he leaned back against the
opposite arm with his hands raised and interlocked behind his
head.&nbsp; &ldquo;On the supposition that a certain
perfection&rsquo;s possible and even desirable&mdash;isn&rsquo;t
it so?&nbsp; Well, all I say is that one&rsquo;s children
interfere with perfection.&nbsp; One&rsquo;s wife
interferes.&nbsp; Marriage interferes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You think then the artist shouldn&rsquo;t
marry?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He does so at his peril&mdash;he does so at his
cost.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not even when his wife&rsquo;s in sympathy with his
work?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She never is&mdash;she can&rsquo;t be!&nbsp; Women
haven&rsquo;t a conception of such things.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Surely they on occasion work themselves,&rdquo; Paul
objected.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, very badly indeed.&nbsp; Oh of course, often, they
think they understand, they think they sympathise.&nbsp; Then it
is they&rsquo;re most dangerous.&nbsp; Their idea is that you
shall do a great lot and get a great lot of money.&nbsp; Their
great nobleness and virtue, their exemplary conscientiousness as
British females, is in keeping you up to that.&nbsp; My wife
makes all my bargains with my publishers for me, and has done so
for twenty years.&nbsp; She does it consummately
well&mdash;that&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m really pretty well
off.&nbsp; Aren&rsquo;t you the father of their innocent babes,
and will you withhold from them their natural sustenance?&nbsp;
You asked me the other night if they&rsquo;re not an immense
incentive.&nbsp; Of course they are&mdash;there&rsquo;s no doubt
of that!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Paul turned it over: it took, from eyes he had never felt open
so wide, so much looking at.&nbsp; &ldquo;For myself I&rsquo;ve
an idea I need incentives.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah well then, n&rsquo;en parlons plus!&rdquo; his
companion handsomely smiled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>You</i> are an incentive, I maintain,&rdquo; the
young man went on.&nbsp; &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t affect me in the
way you&rsquo;d apparently like to.&nbsp; Your great success is
what I see&mdash;the pomp of Ennismore Gardens!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Success?&rdquo;&mdash;St. George&rsquo;s eyes had a
cold fine light.&nbsp; &ldquo;Do you call it success to be spoken
of as you&rsquo;d speak of me if you were sitting here with
another artist&mdash;a young man intelligent and sincere like
yourself?&nbsp; Do you call it success to make you blush&mdash;as
you would blush!&mdash;if some foreign critic (some fellow, of
course I mean, who should know what he was talking about and
should have shown you he did, as foreign critics like to show it)
were to say to you: &lsquo;He&rsquo;s the one, in this country,
whom they consider the most perfect, isn&rsquo;t he?&rsquo;&nbsp;
Is it success to be the occasion of a young Englishman&rsquo;s
having to stammer as you would have to stammer at such a moment
for old England?&nbsp; No, no; success is to have made people
wriggle to another tune.&nbsp; Do try it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Paul continued all gravely to glow.&nbsp; &ldquo;Try
what?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Try to do some really good work.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh I want to, heaven knows!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you can&rsquo;t do it without
sacrifices&mdash;don&rsquo;t believe that for a moment,&rdquo;
the Master said.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve made none.&nbsp;
I&rsquo;ve had everything.&nbsp; In other words I&rsquo;ve missed
everything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve had the full rich masculine human general
life, with all the responsibilities and duties and burdens and
sorrows and joys&mdash;all the domestic and social initiations
and complications.&nbsp; They must be immensely suggestive,
immensely amusing,&rdquo; Paul anxiously submitted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Amusing?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For a strong man&mdash;yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;ve given me subjects without number, if
that&rsquo;s what you mean; but they&rsquo;ve taken away at the
same time the power to use them.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve touched a
thousand things, but which one of them have I turned into
gold?&nbsp; The artist has to do only with that&mdash;he knows
nothing of any baser metal.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve led the life of the
world, with my wife and my progeny; the clumsy conventional
expensive materialised vulgarised brutalised life of
London.&nbsp; We&rsquo;ve got everything handsome, even a
carriage&mdash;we&rsquo;re perfect Philistines and prosperous
hospitable eminent people.&nbsp; But, my dear fellow, don&rsquo;t
try to stultify yourself and pretend you don&rsquo;t know what we
<i>haven&rsquo;t</i> got.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s bigger than all the
rest.&nbsp; Between artists&mdash;come!&rdquo; the Master wound
up.&nbsp; &ldquo;You know as well as you sit there that
you&rsquo;d put a pistol-ball into your brain if you had written
my books!&rdquo;</p>
<p>It struck his listener that the tremendous talk promised by
him at Summersoft had indeed come off, and with a promptitude, a
fulness, with which the latter&rsquo;s young imagination had
scarcely reckoned.&nbsp; His impression fairly shook him and he
throbbed with the excitement of such deep soundings and such
strange confidences.&nbsp; He throbbed indeed with the conflict
of his feelings&mdash;bewilderment and recognition and alarm,
enjoyment and protest and assent, all commingled with tenderness
(and a kind of shame in the participation) for the sores and
bruises exhibited by so fine a creature, and with a sense of the
tragic secret nursed under his trappings.&nbsp; The idea of
<i>his</i>, Paul Overt&rsquo;s, becoming the occasion of such an
act of humility made him flush and pant, at the same time that
his consciousness was in certain directions too much alive not to
swallow&mdash;and not intensely to taste&mdash;every offered
spoonful of the revelation.&nbsp; It had been his odd fortune to
blow upon the deep waters, to make them surge and break in waves
of strange eloquence.&nbsp; But how couldn&rsquo;t he give out a
passionate contradiction of his host&rsquo;s last extravagance,
how couldn&rsquo;t he enumerate to him the parts of his work he
loved, the splendid things he had found in it, beyond the compass
of any other writer of the day?&nbsp; St. George listened a
while, courteously; then he said, laying his hand on his
visitor&rsquo;s: &ldquo;That&rsquo;s all very well; and if your
idea&rsquo;s to do nothing better there&rsquo;s no reason you
shouldn&rsquo;t have as many good things as I&mdash;as many human
and material appendages, as many sons or daughters, a wife with
as many gowns, a house with as many servants, a stable with as
many horses, a heart with as many aches.&rdquo;&nbsp; The Master
got up when he had spoken thus&mdash;he stood a moment&mdash;near
the sofa looking down on his agitated pupil.&nbsp; &ldquo;Are you
possessed of any property?&rdquo; it occurred to him to ask.</p>
<p>&ldquo;None to speak of.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh well then there&rsquo;s no reason why you
shouldn&rsquo;t make a goodish income&mdash;if you set about it
the right way.&nbsp; Study <i>me</i> for that&mdash;study me
well.&nbsp; You may really have horses.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Paul sat there some minutes without speaking.&nbsp; He looked
straight before him&mdash;he turned over many things.&nbsp; His
friend had wandered away, taking up a parcel of letters from the
table where the roll of proofs had lain.&nbsp; &ldquo;What was
the book Mrs. St. George made you burn&mdash;the one she
didn&rsquo;t like?&rdquo; our young man brought out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The book she made me burn&mdash;how did you know
that?&rdquo;&nbsp; The Master looked up from his letters quite
without the facial convulsion the pupil had feared.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I heard her speak of it at Summersoft.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah yes&mdash;she&rsquo;s proud of it.&nbsp; I
don&rsquo;t know&mdash;it was rather good.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What was it about?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let me see.&rdquo;&nbsp; And he seemed to make an
effort to remember.&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh yes&mdash;it was about
myself.&rdquo;&nbsp; Paul gave an irrepressible groan for the
disappearance of such a production, and the elder man went on:
&ldquo;Oh but <i>you</i> should write it&mdash;<i>you</i> should
do me.&rdquo;&nbsp; And he pulled up&mdash;from the restless
motion that had come upon him; his fine smile a generous
glare.&nbsp; &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a subject, my boy: no end of
stuff in it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Again Paul was silent, but it was all tormenting.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Are there no women who really understand&mdash;who can
take part in a sacrifice?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How can they take part?&nbsp; They themselves are the
sacrifice.&nbsp; They&rsquo;re the idol and the altar and the
flame.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t there even <i>one</i> who sees
further?&rdquo; Paul continued.</p>
<p>For a moment St. George made no answer; after which, having
torn up his letters, he came back to the point all ironic.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Of course I know the one you mean.&nbsp; But not even Miss
Fancourt.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought you admired her so much.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s impossible to admire her more.&nbsp; Are you
in love with her?&rdquo; St. George asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Paul Overt presently said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well then give it up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Paul stared.&nbsp; &ldquo;Give up my
&lsquo;love&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bless me, no.&nbsp; Your idea.&rdquo;&nbsp; And then as
our hero but still gazed: &ldquo;The one you talked with her
about.&nbsp; The idea of a decent perfection.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;d help it&mdash;she&rsquo;d help it!&rdquo;
the young man cried.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For about a year&mdash;the first year, yes.&nbsp; After
that she&rsquo;d be as a millstone round its neck.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Paul frankly wondered.&nbsp; &ldquo;Why she has a passion for
the real thing, for good work&mdash;for everything you and I care
for most.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;You and I&rsquo; is charming, my dear
fellow!&rdquo; his friend laughed.&nbsp; &ldquo;She has it
indeed, but she&rsquo;d have a still greater passion for her
children&mdash;and very proper too.&nbsp; She&rsquo;d insist on
everything&rsquo;s being made comfortable, advantageous,
propitious for them.&nbsp; That isn&rsquo;t the artist&rsquo;s
business.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The artist&mdash;the artist!&nbsp; Isn&rsquo;t he a man
all the same?&rdquo;</p>
<p>St. George had a grand grimace.&nbsp; &ldquo;I mostly think
not.&nbsp; You know as well as I what he has to do: the
concentration, the finish, the independence he must strive for
from the moment he begins to wish his work really decent.&nbsp;
Ah my young friend, his relation to women, and especially to the
one he&rsquo;s most intimately concerned with, is at the mercy of
the damning fact that whereas he can in the nature of things have
but one standard, they have about fifty.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s what
makes them so superior,&rdquo; St. George amusingly added.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Fancy an artist with a change of standards as you&rsquo;d
have a change of shirts or of dinner-plates.&nbsp; To <i>do</i>
it&mdash;to do it and make it divine&mdash;is the only thing he
has to think about.&nbsp; &lsquo;Is it done or not?&rsquo; is his
only question.&nbsp; Not &lsquo;Is it done as well as a proper
solicitude for my dear little family will allow?&rsquo;&nbsp; He
has nothing to do with the relative&mdash;he has only to do with
the absolute; and a dear little family may represent a dozen
relatives.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you don&rsquo;t allow him the common passions and
affections of men?&rdquo; Paul asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hasn&rsquo;t he a passion, an affection, which includes
all the rest?&nbsp; Besides, let him have all the passions he
likes&mdash;if he only keeps his independence.&nbsp; He must be
able to be poor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Paul slowly got up.&nbsp; &ldquo;Why then did you advise me to
make up to her?&rdquo;</p>
<p>St. George laid his hand on his shoulder.&nbsp; &ldquo;Because
she&rsquo;d make a splendid wife!&nbsp; And I hadn&rsquo;t read
you then.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The young man had a strained smile.&nbsp; &ldquo;I wish you
had left me alone!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know that that wasn&rsquo;t good enough
for you,&rdquo; his host returned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What a false position, what a condemnation of the
artist, that he&rsquo;s a mere disfranchised monk and can produce
his effect only by giving up personal happiness.&nbsp; What an
arraignment of art!&rdquo; Paul went on with a trembling
voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah you don&rsquo;t imagine by chance that I&rsquo;m
defending art?&nbsp; &lsquo;Arraignment&rsquo;&mdash;I should
think so!&nbsp; Happy the societies in which it hasn&rsquo;t made
its appearance, for from the moment it comes they have a
consuming ache, they have an incurable corruption, in their
breast.&nbsp; Most assuredly is the artist in a false
position!&nbsp; But I thought we were taking him for
granted.&nbsp; Pardon me,&rdquo; St. George continued:
&ldquo;&lsquo;Ginistrella&rsquo; made me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Paul stood looking at the floor&mdash;one o&rsquo;clock
struck, in the stillness, from a neighbouring church-tower.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Do you think she&rsquo;d ever look at me?&rdquo; he put to
his friend at last.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Miss Fancourt&mdash;as a suitor?&nbsp; Why
shouldn&rsquo;t I think it?&nbsp; That&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;ve
tried to favour you&mdash;I&rsquo;ve had a little chance or two
of bettering your opportunity.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Forgive my asking you, but do you mean by keeping away
yourself?&rdquo; Paul said with a blush.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m an old idiot&mdash;my place isn&rsquo;t
there,&rdquo; St. George stated gravely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m nothing yet, I&rsquo;ve no fortune; and there
must be so many others,&rdquo; his companion pursued.</p>
<p>The Master took this considerably in, but made little of
it.&nbsp; &ldquo;You&rsquo;re a gentleman and a man of
genius.&nbsp; I think you might do something.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But if I must give that up&mdash;the genius?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lots of people, you know, think I&rsquo;ve kept
mine,&rdquo; St. George wonderfully grinned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve a genius for mystification!&rdquo; Paul
declared; but grasping his hand gratefully in attenuation of this
judgement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Poor dear boy, I do worry you!&nbsp; But try, try, all
the same.&nbsp; I think your chances are good and you&rsquo;ll
win a great prize.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Paul held fast the other&rsquo;s hand a minute; he looked into
the strange deep face.&nbsp; &ldquo;No, I <i>am</i> an
artist&mdash;I can&rsquo;t help it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah show it then!&rdquo; St. George pleadingly broke
out.&nbsp; &ldquo;Let me see before I die the thing I most want,
the thing I yearn for: a life in which the
passion&mdash;ours&mdash;is really intense.&nbsp; If you can be
rare don&rsquo;t fail of it!&nbsp; Think what it is&mdash;how it
counts&mdash;how it lives!&rdquo;</p>
<p>They had moved to the door and he had closed both his hands
over his companion&rsquo;s.&nbsp; Here they paused again and our
hero breathed deep.&nbsp; &ldquo;I want to live!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In what sense?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the greatest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well then stick to it&mdash;see it through.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;With your sympathy&mdash;your help?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Count on that&mdash;you&rsquo;ll be a great figure to
me.&nbsp; Count on my highest appreciation, my devotion.&nbsp;
You&rsquo;ll give me satisfaction&mdash;if that has any weight
with you.&rdquo;&nbsp; After which, as Paul appeared still to
waver, his host added: &ldquo;Do you remember what you said to me
at Summersoft?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Something infatuated, no doubt!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I&rsquo;ll do anything in the world you tell
me.&rsquo;&nbsp; You said that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you hold me to it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah what am I?&rdquo; the Master expressively
sighed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lord, what things I shall have to do!&rdquo; Paul
almost moaned as be departed.</p>
<h2><a name="page98"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
98</span>VI</h2>
<p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">It</span> goes on too much
abroad&mdash;hang abroad!&rdquo;&nbsp; These or something like
them had been the Master&rsquo;s remarkable words in relation to
the action of &ldquo;Ginistrella&rdquo;; and yet, though they had
made a sharp impression on the author of that work, like almost
all spoken words from the same source, he a week after the
conversation I have noted left England for a long absence and
full of brave intentions.&nbsp; It is not a perversion of the
truth to pronounce that encounter the direct cause of his
departure.&nbsp; If the oral utterance of the eminent writer had
the privilege of moving him deeply it was especially on his
turning it over at leisure, hours and days later, that it
appeared to yield him its full meaning and exhibit its extreme
importance.&nbsp; He spent the summer in Switzerland and, having
in September begun a new task, determined not to cross the Alps
till he should have made a good start.&nbsp; To this end he
returned to a quiet corner he knew well, on the edge of the Lake
of Geneva and within sight of the towers of Chillon: a region and
a view for which he had an affection that sprang from old
associations and was capable of mysterious revivals and
refreshments.&nbsp; Here he lingered late, till the snow was on
the nearer hills, almost down to the limit to which he could
climb when his stint, on the shortening afternoons, was
performed.&nbsp; The autumn was fine, the lake was blue and his
book took form and direction.&nbsp; These felicities, for the
time, embroidered his life, which he suffered to cover him with
its mantle.&nbsp; At the end of six weeks he felt he had learnt
St. George&rsquo;s lesson by heart, had tested and proved its
doctrine.&nbsp; Nevertheless he did a very inconsistent thing:
before crossing the Alps he wrote to Marian Fancourt.&nbsp; He
was aware of the perversity of this act, and it was only as a
luxury, an amusement, the reward of a strenuous autumn, that he
justified it.&nbsp; She had asked of him no such favour when,
shortly before he left London, three days after their dinner in
Ennismore Gardens, he went to take leave of her.&nbsp; It was
true she had had no ground&mdash;he hadn&rsquo;t named his
intention of absence.&nbsp; He had kept his counsel for want of
due assurance: it was that particular visit that was, the next
thing, to settle the matter.&nbsp; He had paid the visit to see
how much he really cared for her, and quick departure, without so
much as an explicit farewell, was the sequel to this enquiry, the
answer to which had created within him a deep yearning.&nbsp;
When he wrote her from Clarens he noted that he owed her an
explanation (more than three months after!) for not having told
her what he was doing.</p>
<p>She replied now briefly but promptly, and gave him a striking
piece of news: that of the death, a week before, of Mrs. St.
George.&nbsp; This exemplary woman had succumbed, in the country,
to a violent attack of inflammation of the lungs&mdash;he would
remember that for a long time she had been delicate.&nbsp; Miss
Fancourt added that she believed her husband overwhelmed by the
blow; he would miss her too terribly&mdash;she had been
everything in life to him.&nbsp; Paul Overt, on this, immediately
wrote to St. George.&nbsp; He would from the day of their parting
have been glad to remain in communication with him, but had
hitherto lacked the right excuse for troubling so busy a
man.&nbsp; Their long nocturnal talk came back to him in every
detail, but this was no bar to an expression of proper sympathy
with the head of the profession, for hadn&rsquo;t that very talk
made it clear that the late accomplished lady was the influence
that ruled his life?&nbsp; What catastrophe could be more cruel
than the extinction of such an influence?&nbsp; This was to be
exactly the tone taken by St. George in answering his young
friend upwards of a month later.&nbsp; He made no allusion of
course to their important discussion.&nbsp; He spoke of his wife
as frankly and generously as if he had quite forgotten that
occasion, and the feeling of deep bereavement was visible in his
words.&nbsp; &ldquo;She took everything off my hands&mdash;off my
mind.&nbsp; She carried on our life with the greatest art, the
rarest devotion, and I was free, as few men can have been, to
drive my pen, to shut myself up with my trade.&nbsp; This was a
rare service&mdash;the highest she could have rendered me.&nbsp;
Would I could have acknowledged it more fitly!&rdquo;</p>
<p>A certain bewilderment, for our hero, disengaged itself from
these remarks: they struck him as a contradiction, a
retractation, strange on the part of a man who hadn&rsquo;t the
excuse of witlessness.&nbsp; He had certainly not expected his
correspondent to rejoice in the death of his wife, and it was
perfectly in order that the rupture of a tie of more than twenty
years should have left him sore.&nbsp; But if she had been so
clear a blessing what in the name of consistency had the dear man
meant by turning him upside down that night&mdash;by dosing him
to that degree, at the most sensitive hour of his life, with the
doctrine of renunciation?&nbsp; If Mrs. St. George was an
irreparable loss, then her husband&rsquo;s inspired advice had
been a bad joke and renunciation was a mistake.&nbsp; Overt was
on the point of rushing back to London to show that, for his
part, he was perfectly willing to consider it so, and he went so
far as to take the manuscript of the first chapters of his new
book out of his table-drawer, to insert it into a pocket of his
portmanteau.&nbsp; This led to his catching a glimpse of certain
pages he hadn&rsquo;t looked at for months, and that accident, in
turn, to his being struck with the high promise they
revealed&mdash;a rare result of such retrospections, which it was
his habit to avoid as much as possible: they usually brought home
to him that the glow of composition might be a purely subjective
and misleading emotion.&nbsp; On this occasion a certain belief
in himself disengaged itself whimsically from the serried
erasures of his first draft, making him think it best after all
to pursue his present trial to the end.&nbsp; If he could write
as well under the rigour of privation it might be a mistake to
change the conditions before that spell had spent itself.&nbsp;
He would go back to London of course, but he would go back only
when he should have finished his book.&nbsp; This was the vow he
privately made, restoring his manuscript to the
table-drawer.&nbsp; It may be added that it took him a long time
to finish his book, for the subject was as difficult as it was
fine, and he was literally embarrassed by the fulness of his
notes.&nbsp; Something within him warned him that he must make it
supremely good&mdash;otherwise he should lack, as regards his
private behaviour, a handsome excuse.&nbsp; He had a horror of
this deficiency and found himself as firm as need be on the
question of the lamp and the file.&nbsp; He crossed the Alps at
last and spent the winter, the spring, the ensuing summer, in
Italy, where still, at the end of a twelvemonth, his task was
unachieved.&nbsp; &ldquo;Stick to it&mdash;see it through&rdquo;:
this general injunction of St. George&rsquo;s was good also for
the particular case.&nbsp; He applied it to the utmost, with the
result that when in its slow order the summer had come round
again he felt he had given all that was in him.&nbsp; This time
he put his papers into his portmanteau, with the address of his
publisher attached, and took his way northward.</p>
<p>He had been absent from London for two years&mdash;two years
which, seeming to count as more, had made such a difference in
his own life&mdash;through the production of a novel far
stronger, he believed, than &ldquo;Ginistrella&rdquo;&mdash;that
he turned out into Piccadilly, the morning after his arrival,
with a vague expectation of changes, of finding great things had
happened.&nbsp; But there were few transformations in
Piccadilly&mdash;only three or four big red houses where there
had been low black ones&mdash;and the brightness of the end of
June peeped through the rusty railings of the Green Park and
glittered in the varnish of the rolling carriages as he had seen
it in other, more cursory Junes.&nbsp; It was a greeting he
appreciated; it seemed friendly and pointed, added to the
exhilaration of his finished book, of his having his own country
and the huge oppressive amusing city that suggested everything,
that contained everything, under his hand again.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Stay at home and do things here&mdash;do subjects we can
measure,&rdquo; St. George had said; and now it struck him he
should ask nothing better than to stay at home for ever.&nbsp;
Late in the afternoon he took his way to Manchester Square,
looking out for a number he hadn&rsquo;t forgotten.&nbsp; Miss
Fancourt, however, was not at home, so that he turned rather
dejectedly from the door.&nbsp; His movement brought him face to
face with a gentleman just approaching it and recognised on
another glance as Miss Fancourt&rsquo;s father.&nbsp; Paul
saluted this personage, and the General returned the greeting
with his customary good manner&mdash;a manner so good, however,
that you could never tell whether it meant he placed you.&nbsp;
The disappointed caller felt the impulse to address him; then,
hesitating, became both aware of having no particular remark to
make, and convinced that though the old soldier remembered him he
remembered him wrong.&nbsp; He therefore went his way without
computing the irresistible effect his own evident recognition
would have on the General, who never neglected a chance to
gossip.&nbsp; Our young man&rsquo;s face was expressive, and
observation seldom let it pass.&nbsp; He hadn&rsquo;t taken ten
steps before he heard himself called after with a friendly
semi-articulate &ldquo;Er&mdash;I beg your pardon!&rdquo;&nbsp;
He turned round and the General, smiling at him from the porch,
said: &ldquo;Won&rsquo;t you come in?&nbsp; I won&rsquo;t leave
you the advantage of me!&rdquo;&nbsp; Paul declined to come in,
and then felt regret, for Miss Fancourt, so late in the
afternoon, might return at any moment.&nbsp; But her father gave
him no second chance; he appeared mainly to wish not to have
struck him as ungracious.&nbsp; A further look at the visitor had
recalled something, enough at least to enable him to say:
&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve come back, you&rsquo;ve come
back?&rdquo;&nbsp; Paul was on the point of replying that he had
come back the night before, but he suppressed, the next instant,
this strong light on the immediacy of his visit and, giving
merely a general assent, alluded to the young lady he deplored
not having found.&nbsp; He had come late in the hope she would be
in.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell her&mdash;I&rsquo;ll tell
her,&rdquo; said the old man; and then he added quickly,
gallantly: &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll be giving us something new?&nbsp;
It&rsquo;s a long time, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;&nbsp; Now he
remembered him right.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rather long.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m very slow.&rdquo; Paul
explained.&nbsp; &ldquo;I met you at Summersoft a long time
ago.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh yes&mdash;with Henry St. George.&nbsp; I remember
very well.&nbsp; Before his poor wife&mdash;&rdquo; General
Fancourt paused a moment, smiling a little less.&nbsp; &ldquo;I
dare say you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;About Mrs. St. George&rsquo;s death?&nbsp;
Certainly&mdash;I heard at the time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh no, I mean&mdash;I mean he&rsquo;s to be
married.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah I&rsquo;ve not heard that!&rdquo;&nbsp; But just as
Paul was about to add &ldquo;To whom?&rdquo; the General crossed
his intention.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When did you come back?&nbsp; I know you&rsquo;ve been
away&mdash;by my daughter.&nbsp; She was very sorry.&nbsp; You
ought to give her something new.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I came back last night,&rdquo; said our young man, to
whom something had occurred which made his speech for the moment
a little thick.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah most kind of you to come so soon.&nbsp;
Couldn&rsquo;t you turn up at dinner?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;At dinner?&rdquo; Paul just mechanically repeated, not
liking to ask whom St. George was going to marry, but thinking
only of that.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There are several people, I believe.&nbsp; Certainly
St. George.&nbsp; Or afterwards if you like better.&nbsp; I
believe my daughter expects&mdash;&rdquo;&nbsp; He appeared to
notice something in the visitor&rsquo;s raised face (on his steps
he stood higher) which led him to interrupt himself, and the
interruption gave him a momentary sense of awkwardness, from
which he sought a quick issue.&nbsp; &ldquo;Perhaps then you
haven&rsquo;t heard she&rsquo;s to be married.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Paul gaped again.&nbsp; &ldquo;To be married?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To Mr. St. George&mdash;it has just been settled.&nbsp;
Odd marriage, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;&nbsp; Our listener uttered
no opinion on this point: he only continued to stare.&nbsp;
&ldquo;But I dare say it will do&mdash;she&rsquo;s so awfully
literary!&rdquo; said the General.</p>
<p>Paul had turned very red.&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh it&rsquo;s a
surprise&mdash;very interesting, very charming!&nbsp; I&rsquo;m
afraid I can&rsquo;t dine&mdash;so many thanks!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you must come to the wedding!&rdquo; cried the
General.&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh I remember that day at Summersoft.&nbsp;
He&rsquo;s a great man, you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Charming&mdash;charming!&rdquo; Paul stammered for
retreat.&nbsp; He shook hands with the General and got off.&nbsp;
His face was red and he had the sense of its growing more and
more crimson.&nbsp; All the evening at home&mdash;he went
straight to his rooms and remained there dinnerless&mdash;his
cheek burned at intervals as if it had been smitten.&nbsp; He
didn&rsquo;t understand what had happened to him, what trick had
been played him, what treachery practised.&nbsp; &ldquo;None,
none,&rdquo; he said to himself.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve nothing
to do with it.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m out of it&mdash;it&rsquo;s none of
my business.&rdquo;&nbsp; But that bewildered murmur was followed
again and again by the incongruous ejaculation: &ldquo;Was it a
plan&mdash;was it a plan?&rdquo;&nbsp; Sometimes he cried to
himself, breathless, &ldquo;Have I been duped, sold,
swindled?&rdquo;&nbsp; If at all, he was an absurd, an abject
victim.&nbsp; It was as if he hadn&rsquo;t lost her till
now.&nbsp; He had renounced her, yes; but that was another
affair&mdash;that was a closed but not a locked door.&nbsp; Now
he seemed to see the door quite slammed in his face.&nbsp; Did he
expect her to wait&mdash;was she to give him his time like that:
two years at a stretch?&nbsp; He didn&rsquo;t know what he had
expected&mdash;he only knew what he hadn&rsquo;t.&nbsp; It
wasn&rsquo;t this&mdash;it wasn&rsquo;t this.&nbsp; Mystification
bitterness and wrath rose and boiled in him when he thought of
the deference, the devotion, the credulity with which he had
listened to St. George.&nbsp; The evening wore on and the light
was long; but even when it had darkened he remained without a
lamp.&nbsp; He had flung himself on the sofa, where he lay
through the hours with his eyes either closed or gazing at the
gloom, in the attitude of a man teaching himself to bear
something, to bear having been made a fool of.&nbsp; He had made
it too easy&mdash;that idea passed over him like a hot
wave.&nbsp; Suddenly, as he heard eleven o&rsquo;clock strike, he
jumped up, remembering what General Fancourt had said about his
coming after dinner.&nbsp; He&rsquo;d go&mdash;he&rsquo;d see her
at least; perhaps he should see what it meant.&nbsp; He felt as
if some of the elements of a hard sum had been given him and the
others were wanting: he couldn&rsquo;t do his sum till he had got
all his figures.</p>
<p>He dressed and drove quickly, so that by half-past eleven he
was at Manchester Square.&nbsp; There were a good many carriages
at the door&mdash;a party was going on; a circumstance which at
the last gave him a slight relief, for now he would rather see
her in a crowd.&nbsp; People passed him on the staircase; they
were going away, going &ldquo;on&rdquo; with the hunted herdlike
movement of London society at night.&nbsp; But sundry groups
remained in the drawing-room, and it was some minutes, as she
didn&rsquo;t hear him announced, before he discovered and spoke
to her.&nbsp; In this short interval he had seen St. George
talking to a lady before the fireplace; but he at once looked
away, feeling unready for an encounter, and therefore
couldn&rsquo;t be sure the author of &ldquo;Shadowmere&rdquo;
noticed him.&nbsp; At all events he didn&rsquo;t come over though
Miss Fancourt did as soon as she saw him&mdash;she almost rushed
at him, smiling rustling radiant beautiful.&nbsp; He had
forgotten what her head, what her face offered to the sight; she
was in white, there were gold figures on her dress and her hair
was a casque of gold.&nbsp; He saw in a single moment that she
was happy, happy with an aggressive splendour.&nbsp; But she
wouldn&rsquo;t speak to him of that, she would speak only of
himself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m so delighted; my father told me.&nbsp; How
kind of you to come!&rdquo;&nbsp; She struck him as so fresh and
brave, while his eyes moved over her, that he said to himself
irresistibly: &ldquo;Why to him, why not to youth, to strength,
to ambition, to a future?&nbsp; Why, in her rich young force, to
failure, to abdication to superannuation?&rdquo;&nbsp; In his
thought at that sharp moment he blasphemed even against all that
had been left of his faith in the peccable Master.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m so sorry I missed you,&rdquo; she went on.&nbsp;
&ldquo;My father told me.&nbsp; How charming of you to have come
so soon!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Does that surprise you?&rdquo; Paul Overt asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The first day?&nbsp; No, from you&mdash;nothing
that&rsquo;s nice.&rdquo;&nbsp; She was interrupted by a lady who
bade her good-night, and he seemed to read that it cost her
nothing to speak to him in that tone; it was her old liberal
lavish way, with a certain added amplitude that time had brought;
and if this manner began to operate on the spot, at such a
juncture in her history, perhaps in the other days too it had
meant just as little or as much&mdash;a mere mechanical charity,
with the difference now that she was satisfied, ready to give but
in want of nothing.&nbsp; Oh she was satisfied&mdash;and why
shouldn&rsquo;t she be?&nbsp; Why shouldn&rsquo;t she have been
surprised at his coming the first day&mdash;for all the good she
had ever got from him?&nbsp; As the lady continued to hold her
attention Paul turned from her with a strange irritation in his
complicated artistic soul and a sort of disinterested
disappointment.&nbsp; She was so happy that it was almost
stupid&mdash;a disproof of the extraordinary intelligence he had
formerly found in her.&nbsp; Didn&rsquo;t she know how bad St.
George could be, hadn&rsquo;t she recognised the awful
thinness&mdash;?&nbsp; If she didn&rsquo;t she was nothing, and
if she did why such an insolence of serenity?&nbsp; This question
expired as our young man&rsquo;s eyes settled at last on the
genius who had advised him in a great crisis.&nbsp; St. George
was still before the chimney-piece, but now he was
alone&mdash;fixed, waiting, as if he meant to stop after every
one&mdash;and he met the clouded gaze of the young friend so
troubled as to the degree of his right (the right his resentment
would have enjoyed) to regard himself as a victim.&nbsp; Somehow
the ravage of the question was checked by the Master&rsquo;s
radiance.&nbsp; It was as fine in its way as Marian
Fancourt&rsquo;s, it denoted the happy human being; but also it
represented to Paul Overt that the author of
&ldquo;Shadowmere&rdquo; had now definitely ceased to
count&mdash;ceased to count as a writer.&nbsp; As he smiled a
welcome across the place he was almost banal, was almost
smug.&nbsp; Paul fancied that for a moment he hesitated to make a
movement, as if for all the world he <i>had</i> his bad
conscience; then they had already met in the middle of the room
and had shaken hands&mdash;expressively, cordially on St.
George&rsquo;s part.&nbsp; With which they had passed back
together to where the elder man had been standing, while St.
George said: &ldquo;I hope you&rsquo;re never going away
again.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve been dining here; the General told
me.&rdquo;&nbsp; He was handsome, he was young, he looked as if
he had still a great fund of life.&nbsp; He bent the friendliest,
most unconfessing eyes on his disciple of a couple of years
before; asked him about everything, his health, his plans, his
late occupations, the new book.&nbsp; &ldquo;When will it be
out&mdash;soon, soon, I hope?&nbsp; Splendid, eh?&nbsp;
That&rsquo;s right; you&rsquo;re a comfort, you&rsquo;re a
luxury!&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve read you all over again these last six
months.&rdquo;&nbsp; Paul waited to see if he would tell him what
the General had told him in the afternoon and what Miss Fancourt,
verbally at least, of course hadn&rsquo;t.&nbsp; But as it
didn&rsquo;t come out he at last put the question.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is it true, the great news I hear&mdash;that
you&rsquo;re to be married?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah you have heard it then?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t the General tell you?&rdquo; Paul
asked.</p>
<p>The Master&rsquo;s face was wonderful.&nbsp; &ldquo;Tell me
what?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That he mentioned it to me this afternoon?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear fellow, I don&rsquo;t remember.&nbsp;
We&rsquo;ve been in the midst of people.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m sorry,
in that case, that I lose the pleasure, myself, of announcing to
you a fact that touches me so nearly.&nbsp; It <i>is</i> a fact,
strange as it may appear.&nbsp; It has only just become
one.&nbsp; Isn&rsquo;t it ridiculous?&rdquo;&nbsp; St. George
made this speech without confusion, but on the other hand, so far
as our friend could judge, without latent impudence.&nbsp; It
struck his interlocutor that, to talk so comfortably and coolly,
he must simply have forgotten what had passed between them.&nbsp;
His next words, however, showed he hadn&rsquo;t, and they
produced, as an appeal to Paul&rsquo;s own memory, an effect
which would have been ludicrous if it hadn&rsquo;t been
cruel.&nbsp; &ldquo;Do you recall the talk we had at my house
that night, into which Miss Fancourt&rsquo;s name entered?&nbsp;
I&rsquo;ve often thought of it since.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes; no wonder you said what you did&rdquo;&mdash;Paul
was careful to meet his eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the light of the present occasion?&nbsp; Ah but
there was no light then.&nbsp; How could I have foreseen this
hour?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t you think it probable?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Upon my honour, no,&rdquo; said Henry St. George.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Certainly I owe you that assurance.&nbsp; Think how my
situation has changed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see&mdash;I see,&rdquo; our young man murmured.</p>
<p>His companion went on as if, now that the subject had been
broached, he was, as a person of imagination and tact, quite
ready to give every satisfaction&mdash;being both by his genius
and his method so able to enter into everything another might
feel.&nbsp; &ldquo;But it&rsquo;s not only that; for honestly, at
my age, I never dreamed&mdash;a widower with big boys and with so
little else!&nbsp; It has turned out differently from anything
one could have dreamed, and I&rsquo;m fortunate beyond all
measure.&nbsp; She has been so free, and yet she consents.&nbsp;
Better than any one else perhaps&mdash;for I remember how you
liked her before you went away, and how she liked you&mdash;you
can intelligently congratulate me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She has been so free!&rdquo;&nbsp; Those words made a
great impression on Paul Overt, and he almost writhed under that
irony in them as to which it so little mattered whether it was
designed or casual.&nbsp; Of course she had been free, and
appreciably perhaps by his own act; for wasn&rsquo;t the
Master&rsquo;s allusion to her having liked him a part of the
irony too?&nbsp; &ldquo;I thought that by your theory you
disapproved of a writer&rsquo;s marrying.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Surely&mdash;surely.&nbsp; But you don&rsquo;t call me
a writer?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You ought to be ashamed,&rdquo; said Paul.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ashamed of marrying again?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t say that&mdash;but ashamed of your
reasons.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The elder man beautifully smiled.&nbsp; &ldquo;You must let me
judge of them, my good friend.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes; why not?&nbsp; For you judged wonderfully of
mine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The tone of these words appeared suddenly, for St. George, to
suggest the unsuspected.&nbsp; He stared as if divining a
bitterness.&nbsp; &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you think I&rsquo;ve been
straight?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You might have told me at the time perhaps.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear fellow, when I say I couldn&rsquo;t pierce
futurity&mdash;!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I mean afterwards.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Master wondered.&nbsp; &ldquo;After my wife&rsquo;s
death?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When this idea came to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah never, never!&nbsp; I wanted to save you, rare and
precious as you are.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Poor Overt looked hard at him.&nbsp; &ldquo;Are you marrying
Miss Fancourt to save me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not absolutely, but it adds to the pleasure.&nbsp; I
shall be the making of you,&rdquo; St. George smiled.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I was greatly struck, after our talk, with the brave
devoted way you quitted the country, and still more perhaps with
your force of character in remaining abroad.&nbsp; You&rsquo;re
very strong&mdash;you&rsquo;re wonderfully strong.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Paul tried to sound his shining eyes; the strange thing was
that he seemed sincere&mdash;not a mocking fiend.&nbsp; He turned
away, and as he did so heard the Master say something about his
giving them all the proof, being the joy of his old age.&nbsp; He
faced him again, taking another look.&nbsp; &ldquo;Do you mean to
say you&rsquo;ve stopped writing?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear fellow, of course I have.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s too
late.&nbsp; Didn&rsquo;t I tell you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t believe it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course you can&rsquo;t&mdash;with your own
talent!&nbsp; No, no; for the rest of my life I shall only read
<i>you</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Does she know that&mdash;Miss Fancourt?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She will&mdash;she will.&rdquo;&nbsp; Did he mean this,
our young man wondered, as a covert intimation that the
assistance he should derive from that young lady&rsquo;s fortune,
moderate as it was, would make the difference of putting it in
his power to cease to work ungratefully an exhausted vein?&nbsp;
Somehow, standing there in the ripeness of his successful
manhood, he didn&rsquo;t suggest that any of his veins were
exhausted.&nbsp; &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you remember the moral I
offered myself to you that night as pointing?&rdquo; St. George
continued.&nbsp; &ldquo;Consider at any rate the warning I am at
present.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This was too much&mdash;he <i>was</i> the mocking fiend.&nbsp;
Paul turned from him with a mere nod for good-night and the sense
in a sore heart that he might come back to him and his easy
grace, his fine way of arranging things, some time in the far
future, but couldn&rsquo;t fraternise with him now.&nbsp; It was
necessary to his soreness to believe for the hour in the
intensity of his grievance&mdash;all the more cruel for its not
being a legal one.&nbsp; It was doubtless in the attitude of
hugging this wrong that he descended the stairs without taking
leave of Miss Fancourt, who hadn&rsquo;t been in view at the
moment he quitted the room.&nbsp; He was glad to get out into the
honest dusky unsophisticating night, to move fast, to take his
way home on foot.&nbsp; He walked a long time, going astray,
paying no attention.&nbsp; He was thinking of too many other
things.&nbsp; His steps recovered their direction, however, and
at the end of an hour he found himself before his door in the
small inexpensive empty street.&nbsp; He lingered, questioning
himself still before going in, with nothing around and above him
but moonless blackness, a bad lamp or two and a few far-away dim
stars.&nbsp; To these last faint features he raised his eyes; he
had been saying to himself that he should have been
&ldquo;sold&rdquo; indeed, diabolically sold, if now, on his new
foundation, at the end of a year, St. George were to put forth
something of his prime quality&mdash;something of the type of
&ldquo;Shadowmere&rdquo; and finer than his finest.&nbsp; Greatly
as he admired his talent Paul literally hoped such an incident
wouldn&rsquo;t occur; it seemed to him just then that he
shouldn&rsquo;t be able to bear it.&nbsp; His late
adviser&rsquo;s words were still in his
ears&mdash;&ldquo;You&rsquo;re very strong, wonderfully
strong.&rdquo;&nbsp; Was he really?&nbsp; Certainly he would have
to be, and it might a little serve for revenge.&nbsp; <i>Is</i>
he? the reader may ask in turn, if his interest has followed the
perplexed young man so far.&nbsp; The best answer to that perhaps
is that he&rsquo;s doing his best, but that it&rsquo;s too soon
to say.&nbsp; When the new book came out in the autumn Mr. and
Mrs. St. George found it really magnificent.&nbsp; The former
still has published nothing but Paul doesn&rsquo;t even yet feel
safe.&nbsp; I may say for him, however, that if this event were
to occur he would really be the very first to appreciate it:
which is perhaps a proof that the Master was essentially right
and that Nature had dedicated him to intellectual, not to
personal passion.</p>

United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as

effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project

contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
